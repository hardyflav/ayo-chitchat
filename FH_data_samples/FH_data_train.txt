text:Discussion - ‚Äú Odd ‚Äú Fashion Inspirations	labels:I used to be obsessed with Mary Lennox from the 1993 Secret Garden movie. She wears this bright red pom hat, a nice peacoat, and laceup boots while she's outside (typical Edwardian style.) Later she has lace dresses, nightgowns, a sunhat, and hair ribbons typical of that era. She's like 10 years old, but I would still take fashion cues from her!
text:That movie is the reason I became an Anglophile and a fan of Edwardian fashion!	labels:It is \*such\* a good film! I mean, naturally I loved it as a kid, but I watched it recently (I'm in my 30s now) and it holds up! It's beautifully shot, has a wonderful soundtrack, and such great attention to historic detail.	episode_done:True

text:What materials are worth paying more for? What equals quality?	labels:It's pretty hard to discern quality online, which is why I generally avoid online shopping for clothes. But I know that's not helpful advice, especially right now, lol. When I do buy clothes online, I make it a point to look at the reviews. If they're allowed to post photos, you get a better idea of what the item really looks like. Keep an eye out for common issues, are there multiple reviews complaining about the fabric being sheer, or the stitching being flimsy?	episode_done:True

text:Are our ideas about what looks ‚Äúdated‚Äù on either ourselves or others affected by or correlated with our age?	labels:Yes, I do think our age definitely affects what looks dated to our eye.   I‚Äôm noticing that some younger men are wearing some strange iterations of 80‚Äôs color-blocked track suits that to me look very Golden Girls. Also, I‚Äôve seen shirt and shorts sets on rappers made out of wild print fabrics exactly like the ones I made for my toddler 25 years ago.  I‚Äôm older, so I‚Äôve seen a lot of trends come and go. We are now at the point where they are starting to repeat and are designated as ‚ÄúVintage‚Äù.  I have cultivated my personal style over many years (boho/western), and have seen it done well by Ralph Lauren and most recently Christian Dior in 2018(?) and enjoy the idea of wearing the beautiful things I‚Äôve collected until the end of my life.

text:Favourite places to get your fall wool fix?	labels:Don‚Äôt forget to check out thrift stores. This is where I stock up on cashmere sweaters for a few dollars a piece, wool skirts, kilts, sweaters, vests, and cardigans, and amazing wool blazers and coats. I‚Äôve found mint condition mohair and camel hair 3/4 coats for as low as $10, black cashmere sweaters for $2-3 and up, and cable knit pullovers for as low as $4. It‚Äôs amazing what people get rid of, not realizing how expensive it all is new. I also loooove wool in the fall and winter, and so this has been a super affordable way to build a dream cold-weather wardrobe.   The only thing wool I buy new are socks for the most part, everything else I‚Äôve found at estate sales, garage sales, and thrift shops. When/if you go, definitely go through the boys and men‚Äôs departments, too. A bit of tailoring can make anything look custom like some of the pieces on Walker Slater maybe.
text:I feel like other people near me know the thrift store magic because I haven't found cashmere there in like 2 years. However, thredup can be good. I despise cotton sweaters because they're not warm enough and wool sweaters are super itchy unless they're merino or cashmere so basically I'm screwed.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:What is your one clothing item that makes your life better that everyone should have?	labels:A well fitted black wool coat in a cut that flatters you. It goes with any outfit. You can dress it up or down, and on early mornings taking the kids to school or late night runs to the store you look like you have your shit together even if your sans bra and wearing 3 day old leggings.

I remember when flares were super in when I was a kid/young teen and all my friends and I would be wandering around with these sopping wet pants slapping around our ankles. Never again.	labels:Thank you! I have been trying to figure out how to wear mom jeans in the winter and all the recommendations are like "wear cute short boots and have a cold gap at the ankle with maybe a sock covering it" and I'm coming to the conclusion that they are for places that aren't actually that cold	episode_done:True
text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - January 07, 2021	labels:I'm in a ambivalent state of mind right now. For a like over a year now I have been into streetwear. Baggy, oversized clothes with lots of prints and branding. This was my first period of taking clothing serious and feeling "fashionable". But one can only see so many of the "same" outfits.  I grew really tired of streetwear in the last couple of weeks but I'm scared to leave my comfort zone. I'm 20 years old but feel like dressing like a teenager. I really really like graphic tees if the prints are well done and If I would imagine dressing like lets say Tim Dessaint for example, who is not into graphics/"crazyness" at all, It would feel too "mature" for my age if that makes sense.  But at the very same time, I feel like im dressing too childish when wearing cargo pants + graphic tee.  Am I overthinking this?
text:Yeah, you're overthinking it.  It's mostly in your head and once you make the shift you'll find yourself slowly becoming comfortable and wondering what the problem was. Tim has plenty of fits that still veer young, and you can always inject some of them with a streetwear sensibility (Streetwear is a broad term nowadays).	labels:	episode_done:True

text:For the parents of girls	labels:My mom and dad bought all my clothes until I got a job and started buying all my own stuff. My mom dressed me until I was about 9 or 10 and then I started picking my own outfits. My mom and I have very similar body types, but somehow my dad was, and still is, better at finding things that fit me nicely. My mom never really pushed her personal style on me and my sister, even though she bought and picked out 99% of our clothes growing up because it‚Äôs just hard to find little girls clothes that are the same style as women‚Äôs. My dad just liked to go in stores on a whim and ask employees what was in style at the moment, so he picked out some pretty good things.
text:I love that your dad was so involved!	labels:He still is! Even though my sister and I are 17 and 19 and have jobs, he still buys us things he finds on eBay for cheap when he‚Äôs bored at work. My sister and I love fashion now so we talk about it a lot and he has picked up on our favorite brands, the ones he remembers best are Free People and Zara. It‚Äôs so funny when he‚Äôs opening his packages of car parts and archery supplies and opens up a dress or jeans that he forgot he bought for us lol.	episode_done:True
text:What inspired your passion/love for fashion?	labels:I remember trying to design dresses when I was seven years old. Then, princesses were my inspiration. After trying to ignore my interest in high school for a few years where I would still find gossip magazines to admire the red carpet looks, my dad brought me W magazine that he had found in his mailbox and looking through it at the art made me so happy. Now I am older and wear scrubs to work and have a baby, but my fashion passion is back and coming to this forum has definitely inspired me to put more love into my image day to day.	episode_done:True

text:What‚Äôs some of the best general advice you‚Äôd give to someone new to female fashion?	labels:I would say start looking into what specific fabrics do and how to clean and treat them. You can invest quite a lot in a good cashmere sweater, but if you don‚Äôt wash it properly no amount of money will safe it. Same goes for a skirt from a fast fashion retailer, is it worth the x amount of money if it is made from an acrylic fabric? Wouldn‚Äôt you rather pay less at a budget retailer for the same quality?	episode_done:True
text:What are your go-to, everyday shoes?	labels:Blundstones in the winter, white keds in the summer. I'm a simple gal. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è  Side note, I wear orthodics so my shoe choices are based on whether I can rip out the insole and fit my orthodics. Unfortunately this means no sandals during the summer unless I really think it's worth it to sacrifice cuteness for knee pain!

Different leathers, construction methods, toe structure, etc. Works out the kinks before they do a full run.

text:How does your makeup style and clothing style relate? - discussion	labels:Im Op I‚Äôll share mine-  Personally I sort of plan my makeup look based of what I‚Äôm wearing   I do mostly dramatic Smokey eyes and cut crease looks with bright blush and lipstick everywhere in colors that either match my outfit or just compliment it well! I also do more eye liner dramatic looks at times as well! Usually if I‚Äôm wearing something a bit more cutesy I‚Äôll do my makeup to reflect the look. If Im wearing my black velvet blazer set I‚Äôll do th√© likes of and orange and gold Smokey eye to make it more bold and less professional looking! I have a very dressy style with masculine, Victorian, and highly detailed elements so bold colorful makeup makes some of my more stuffy looks less boring. I‚Äôve lately been after doing my foundation putting a bit of blush from the bottom front of my eye bags to the top of my brow bone. I love how it makes makeup a little more unique and makes me look a little less baby faced.  I used to wear very skater boyish/ art kid outfits and hair ( I still respect the style still though ) but wore heavy Instagram glam style makeup. I still do glam makeup but it looked quite odd at times! I didn‚Äôt really think much about makeup in relation to clothing then, not that it‚Äôs really necessary! I feel I‚Äôve come far with my style!

text:[Review] TATRAS OFFICIAL BORGOGNONE DOWN JACKET, down for the city	labels:Wow. I learned a new and interesting brand for me:) The style of this parka is a bit like a mix of M-51, n3b.

It looks quite modern and technologically advanced, but at the same time it is not a purely utilitarian "jacket of a polar station worker"   In general, I am impressed by the oversized style.

text:What materials are worth paying more for? What equals quality?	labels:I will pay more for 100% cotton, linen, wool, cashmere and silk.  I will not pay more for anything else in 100% material including denim (uncomfortable), modal, tencel etc. I pay less for mixes, especially if it‚Äôs natural mixed with artificial, that seems to lead to pilling.  As for quality, the best way to tell is to literally feel it. It‚Äôs hard to describe but if you go to the most expensive (especially men‚Äôs clothes and minimalism/ethical focused) boutiques you can find and feel their fabrics, you will develop a touch for it. The material is almost always denser, heavier, and thicker than you are used to. That‚Äôs not to say $$$$ equals quality - but IMO it‚Äôs the best way to ‚Äúlearn by feel‚Äù is to find a large concentration of it. Quality is sometimes super affordable but relatively rare - for example, Hanes ‚Äúultra weight‚Äù t-shirts are some of the best quality 100% cotton tees you can buy and is very cheap (but also no design/super basic).  When I go into a new store - I don‚Äôt even pull out items on ‚Äúsight‚Äù, I pull them out by feel, remember the brands that feel good and then see what else they have.  For online shopping, I stick to the same brands over and over. My favorite t-shirts, tanks and other simple tops for example are from Hanes, Wol Hide, Le Bon Shoppe, The Great, Tela9, Lilla P, and Sunspel. How do I know? I‚Äôve felt them in person, bought them, worn and washed them, and when I need a new item, I go there first.	episode_done:True

I took the test and got theatric romantic, but then I have some features listed in the ‚ÄúWill NOT‚Äù section??

I feel like my face and my body don‚Äôt match according to this	labels:Yeah the test and results were disappointing after the info it provides hypes it up too!	episode_done:True
text:What I Like is Not What I choose to wear	labels:What I like to look at and what I like to wear are not the same thing. I actually think a lot of fashion struggles come from people not understanding how to separate what they find aesthetically interesting from what meets the specific needs in their life.  When you look at a photo of an outfit, you're not *just* reacting to the outfit itself. You're also reacting to the body of the model, the styling choices (makeup and hair), and the photography decisions (the pose, the location, the lighting).   I might look at a photo and think "that person looks so cool in that outfit," but that person isn't me. I would not look that cool in that outfit because I'm a completely different person.  When I choose clothing for myself it needs to satisfy my aesthetic tastes when paired with my body and the amount of effort I'm willing to put into styling (i.e. zero), as well as suit the needs for my daily life. That's actually a limited number of options for me.   But when I am admiring an outfit or a photo, I'm not constrained by my hang ups about my body or the needs of my daily life. I can just like the outfit without having to contextualize it around myself, which is actually quite nice.  So, personally speaking, my interest in fashion isn't limited to clothing I would choose to wear. I find it's much more freeing to allow myself to enjoy fashion and outfits without always questioning whether I would like the outfit on my own body.
text:Totally agreed, and this is why it makes me a bit squirmy when people say "wear what makes you happy!" in this sub, in the sense that it should be the last word in clothing. Yes, of course you should wear what makes you happy, but what makes us happy to wear is not so simple for a lot of people.  There are tons of things I don't particularly love in isolation but make me happy on my body, and conversely things I love in isolation but *don't* love on my body, and that can come from many angles: pure aesthetics but also fit, comfort, personal goals, how I'm treated when I'm wearing it, etc etc. What exact elements contribute to any of these is really the crux of personal fashion, and it's a far more complex conversation than just "wear it if you like it".	labels:Yeah, "wear what you like!" is an unhelpful platitude. It's the "just be happy!" of fashion advice, it doesn't tell you HOW to get where you want.	episode_done:True

text:What designer bags and eras do you think will come back in fashion 2021-2022?	labels:In terms of fashion, I think colors and maximalism will come back, after an entire decade of minimalism.   I was watching Twin Peaks, and what amazed me about the 80s 90s fashion in that show is the vibrancy of colors and patterns. We are already immersed in 80s and 90s revival now, esp in terms of oversized and dramatic fits, and I think gradually crazier colors and patterns will become more mainstream.   Bags - I suppose the more dramatic the better, and we are already seeing crazy shapes and colors now. Celine might start with crazier designs as well, with Slimane at its helm.
text:I think so too. The mom-jeans on trend is often more 80s then 90s. And I've seen shoulder pads, and shoulder "wings" comming in.  I hope for a V silhouette. Possible updated for curvier ideal compared to the slim 80's aerobics girl.  I like it, but I realized my nice winter coats does NOT go with acid wash jeans.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What‚Äôs your opinion on (modern) 90s-inspired fashion?	labels:I'm waiting until we get to the part of the baggy jeans trend when people learn about the ripped, soggy backs of their pant legs that come from the jeans dragging on the ground. Enough of that this time around and the trend will cycle to something else.  signed,  someone who dealt with many, many ripped jean legs.

If you follow me on IG that's the easiest way to hear about updates, but I can edit this comment when it's refreshed, too!   **(11/30 update if anybody is still reading -- the app is updated!)**  Edit: since so many of you are finding the tool mostly useless, I just wanted to say that the goal was to create something that would help you find fashion inspo from people who are more similar in size to you than a fashion model in a magazine.  Of course it's impossible to get an exact body double from just 3 measurements, but that's what the standard is, and that's what I could reasonably expect the average person to know about themselves. I have to make sure that the barrier to entry is very low. The more people can join this index, the more useful it is. Please remember that I offer this tool completely for free, that I don't work in the fashion industry, and that I don't have any background in the industry (fashion, data, or web design). I just wanted to do something helpful for the community. I will try my best to make as many improvements as I can over time, but I have very limited resources, and maintaining it is quite a lot of effort as is. Sorry, all!

text:How do you think access and privilege affect your taste and sense of style?	labels:Was just pondering this the other day, I have always had hand me downs and thrift store finds and other bonus items as my wardrobe. I still have people comment on my style and saying I'm stylish, but fashion and brand choices aren't an option. I make what I can get my hands on work. I hardly ever get rid of anything just in case it will work well with something I get in the future. I wear a lot of more outlandish stuff simply because people would notice how shitty my clothes are if I was trying to dress like everyone else. I'll often get an item of clothing or a pair of shoes as a big birthday present, but anything over ¬£100 is out of my league. Even if I could save it up, there's no way I can justify spending that much of my budget on shiny clothes, especially since there's hardly ever anywhere to wear them!	episode_done:True

Nike is a bitch.  > In a statement, Coca-Cola said that it ‚Äústrictly prohibits any type of forced labor in our supply chain‚Äù and uses third-party auditors to closely monitor its suppliers. It also said that the COFCO Tunhe facility in Xinjiang, which supplies sugar to a local bottling facility and had been linked to allegations of forced labor by The Wall Street Journal and Chinese-language news media, ‚Äúsuccessfully completed an audit in 2019.‚Äù  At least Coke answer it well.	episode_done:True
text:General Discussion - November 29, 2020	labels:Just finished Legend of Korra and it was really good. The first season was good, the second was meh, but seasons 3 and 4 were fantastic. I went into it super skeptical but I think it was a worthy successor to Avatar, although I don't think anything can top that show (it was the only TV series I followed as a kid and I've rewatched it a ton since).
text:I liked it and I think the art style and music match the pace well, however, my only two problems were:  * not nearly as relaxing and soothing as Avatar. Avatar has really nice nature connections that are kinda lost in the city setting The filler episodes in Avatar are relaxing and nice looks into either the nature of bending/human-nature relationships or the friendships/personalities of the characters.   * Korra never learns anything. Aang learned how to solve problems without using his powers and Korra just hits stuff until it‚Äôs fixed. Aang had to grapple with his moral code constantly. Korra just gets the major issue of the end of the first season solved for her with out doing anything. It seemed like an interesting dilemma for her character and she gets out of it with out changing at all or even a hint of self reflection. Plus her villains are all way more interesting and actually have some nuance and personality.	labels:Yeah, I do think that they really missed out on developing most of the characters. Very few of them had an arc similar to Zuko, Sokka, or Katara. They went with more characters with less development, which is just a different approach IMO. I do think she really doesn't show much growth in S1 and S2, which is one of my main complaints. She consistently loses in fights and never really seems to change anything. I also could have used like 100X more meetings with Aang, I think Aang had more time with Roku than Korra had with Aang.	episode_done:True

They look like they‚Äôre wearing the most basic clothes girls wore at my mistake of a Christian college, the removed girls, and *please* do not get me started on the white washing of some of my faves!!! What a major bummer! But your albums brought me joy and also some ideas for my own wardrobe lol!	episode_done:True
text:Harry Styles wears a Gucci gown as Vogue‚Äôs first solo male cover star	labels:I've got nothing wrong with a guy wearing clothes that are traditionally for females, but I don't think any of those looks look good, though I don't know the typical content of Vogue.
text:I agree that there is something that feels off about it but I think part of that is that the articles of clothing are actually very conventionally feminine rather than the typical very masculine jacket dress or avant garde androgynous style. While this causes a whiplash that's kind of the point, it's far further outside the norm to see conventionally feminine gowns paired with a blazer. Is it bad or are we reacting instinctively to violated convention despite pretending on the outside to be aesthetically open minded.   It's putting more emphasis on the clothes gender tension rather than trying to subtly make it masculine.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Can we discuss how uncomfortable it can be to dress fashionably sometimes? Must beauty = pain? Looking for comfort tips!	labels:When I started shopping for function, I started to enjoy fashion a lot more. Uniqlo was a big part of the beginning for me, I really like their airsim and heattech lines. How can my clothes work for me? I really took on a evolutionarily perspective lmao, like I need Shelter from Rain, Insulation in Cold, Sweat Wicking in Sun. It got me to pay attention to fabric choices more, which meant I was pickier, which meant I was buying more expensive items... so then I started to care about the quality of stitching and longevity of the piece.  I had IBS for a year and there were some clothes I could really NOT wear with that, so I had to learn to make adjustments too. I like high-rise bottoms, but I can't have an elastic cutting off my intestines all day, so I get something with a zipper instead.	episode_done:True

text:How do your clothes wear out?	labels:For me, it‚Äôs typically the elasticity of fabrics start to give and the items no longer fit correctly or if it‚Äôs a bottom, they no longer ‚Äústay up‚Äù. This usually happens with leggings or panties after about 5 or more years of regular wear with caring for the items properly.  I also had a faux leather jacket wear out after 6 years of regular wear. The faux leather ended up ‚Äúpeeling off‚Äù or something like that.
text:I had a pair of leather finish jeans from Anne Taylor years ago and the finish slowly gave way until I had a pair of dark jeans.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Organizing Closet: Help!	labels:I suggest organizing and developing categories based on how you work through creating an outfit. Do you need to see items to choose them? If yes, maybe focus on hanging the items you need to see. When you go to pick out a top, how do you decided what you are looking for? Is it color, sleeve length, pattern? Do you mentally group crop tops in the same category as other shirts, or do you specifically look for crop tops? Have you designated some items as work clothes or more formal clothes vs casual? Group your clothing in the categories you put thing into in your head, even if they wouldn't make sense to others (it's your closet after all).     For example, when I'm picking out shirts think about sleeve length and pattern, and I need to see and feel the shirt to make a final decision on what to wear. For what ever reason, sorting by color isnt as big of a priority, but whether I want to wear stripes, plaid, floral, or solid is. So my shirts are hung, divided by sleeve length, then arranged by pattern (like patterns together). I also have separated out my formal clothes and my gold clothes, as those are only used at specific times and dont need to be visually cluttering my daily wardrobe.	episode_done:True
text:What are your favorite tough winter boots?	labels:I'm a fan of Carhartt boots for their durability and traction.

text:It‚Äôs 2021. A vaccine for the virus has been made widely available and businesses may operate at full capacity, including bars, clubs, salons, etc. How will this influence fashion?	labels:I have already started going crazy with upping my statements and dressing to impress when I go to work.  I was off for 6months and had nothing to dress up for.  Now I dress extra super cute every day for work (which I absolutely did not do before) just because I want to look good and I have no where else I really go. ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. I definitely think we are all going to want to look extra when this is all over.

text:How many handbags do you have and which one is your most used?	labels:Currently, I have two Coach and one Kate Spade, but I tend to carry the same bag every day. When I get tired of what I'm carrying, I will switch it out with one I have or buy a new one. If I wanted a luxury bag like Chanel, I would either have to dip into savings for it or put it on credit (which is a no-no for me). I only buy what I consider affordable and that means easily paying cash for it (my range is Coach and Kate Spade).	episode_done:True
text:Suit Supply Review Times Two	labels:While we can't say for certain: is it possible that the second experience is the correct one? A lot of men believe that they need a fully custom suit to fit well, but in actuality for most body types the patterns are rather close. If an OTR size with alterations would look great, paying for MTM is a waste of money. I've done MTM suits and bought OTR suits and have generally found that getting OTR with alterations is a faster way to a well fitting suit than the low to mid level MTM stuff we're talking about here. I've done Indochino MTM which was generally a mess and a tuxedo from Black Lapel which eventually worked out well, following one full remake and $100 of local alterations (that they paid for). My OTR blue line suits from SS fit great after alterations.
text:Yes, I even considered this. It is possible that all the fuss associate with a MTM may just create work and not contribute much to the overall fit. I'm kind of build weird though...rather "wide" with a 36 inch waist, but not pudgy at all. My legs and arms are really thin, so I look like I am completely swimming in most OTR jacket sleeves and trousers. My SS OTR trousers I have do fit well, but not as well as the perfectly tapered MTM ones.  I failed to mention that I own an OTR SS Sienna as well, which I bought online and had altered. The MTM one fits much better, but it's mostly sleeves, shoulders and trousers....so basically all of it.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:General Discussion - December 24, 2020	labels:I alternate between loving and hating my hair. It's super thick and it feels nice, but I can't do ANYTHING with it style-wise without drenching it in product.

text:BoF: J. Crew's New CEO has a Survival Plan: Edit out the Ugly	labels:i just feel like their price points are so high and the quality can be kind of mediocre. they‚Äôre stuck in a weird place where their pricing is too expensive for the average consumer who‚Äôs trained to expect bargains and too cheap for someone who buys luxury or higher end pieces.   even with their random extra 50% off sales, it‚Äôs still above what people expect to pay. but then again, madewell is thriving. (though i think that has more to do with being able to capture an on-trend aesthetic.)
text:Madewell feels like it's a bit less expensive and has better sales than J. Crew but better quality as long as you're not just getting t-shirts there... I have Madewell sweaters that I've had for going on 5 years that are in regular rotation and look mostly new and yet my J Crew ones have holes or have stretched oddly.   Also seconding the sizing that someone else mentioned, I can order online with Madewell and almost guarantee that something will fit, but J Crew has been insanely inconsistent to the point where I just don't shop there anymore.	labels:Madewell is also known for great jeans as a reasonable price. I think that brings a lot of ppl in!	episode_done:True

I sort of knew this, but now it's something I'm conscious of, and will definitely be conscious of when I shop for new clothes.  I also realized a connection between the styles of visual art, music and architecture I like, and the kinds of patterns and colour schemes I like. So that's neat.

text:Fall Fashion Inspo!	labels:I plan on dressing in a lot of wool, plaid, tweed, and leather. I definitely play it safe as I live in a pretty rural area in a conservative part of the country, but I am envisioning lots of plaid, wool shackets, chunky boots, mom jeans, long, wool coats, chunky knit sweaters in neutral/autumnal tones, gold jewelry, leather jackets & pants, etc. I typically wear a lot of earthy tones as well, but I love a pop of red here and there. I'll try to get a board together to put a picture with what I'm describing, but any Youtube video titled Fall 2020 clothing haul will probably give you an idea of what I'll be wearing as I'm not much of a fashion risktaker lol.  I have been searching all the resale sites for vintage wool shackets, as the Zara one I'm interested in keeps selling out and its like 90% polyester anyway. I plan on buying a few vintage pendleton/ll bean/eddie bauer oversized wool flannels to wear as jackets instead.

text:Craig Green Spring 2021 Menswear Collection	labels:Call me crazy, but Craig Green has never done anything for me.  Sure, stuff like 1, 4, 6, 11 looks good, but is ultimately fairly ordinary (and I just don't think making stuff padded is all that innovative).  Fashion-as-art-onto-itself stuff like 10, 17, 22 also looks good (and I guess it earns him his avantgarde cred), but doesn't filter down to the stores.  So there is this gap between fairly ordinary stuff and out-there artworks that he can't seem to fill. But in that gap lives the stuff I'd like to wear.
text:Green has always been one of those designers that I vastly prefer seeing styled by people with other brands than seeing his collections on their own, he‚Äôs got some really cool individual pieces that work well with outfits but I feel you, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd call myself a fan of the CG aesthetic overall.

text:Andrew Marc New York Leather Jackets -- exploring the different "grades" of this brand	labels:What is Andrew Marc quality comparable to?
text:From my own experience, I'd say the best made "vintage" Andrew Marc leather jackets are better than a lot of "mall" brand leather jackets I've owned or tried like Kenneth Cole, Tommy Hilfiger, Reilly Olmes, Ralph Lauren Chaps. I have a Ralph Lauren POLO leather jacket (original MSRP $695) from 1999 made of a heavy leather that has held up wonderfully over the years and I'd say is better than the best Andrew Marc I've tried (but my experience is limited--there may be "gems" out there, like limited editions).	labels:90s Polo is kind of golden era polo, somewhat different to what we have 20 odd years later.      RL Polo iteration one happens in 67' , RRL comes in 93', and then Purple label is in 94', but over the years I think the gap in quality has really widened sadly.
text:Agreed. RRL has changed and isn't what it used to be. I've at least seen that with their jeans. I'd much rather pay less and pick up a lightly used pair from a decade ago rather than something new. I'm not familiar with their recent leather products, though.	labels:Interesting, I always hear RRL as the grail brand

text:Skirts and dresses in winter - how to look good and be warm with a combo of boots, socks, tights?	labels:I live in the freezing north and I still wear skirts in the winter. Because I'm insane and like to look like I'm from the 1890s. (I wear fleece or thick cotton tights with long wool skirts.)  My personal thought is that the height of the shoes doesn't matter if it's wet out. I will just wear snow boots or rain boots if those are called for, and fuck the aesthetic.   If it's just dry but cold, my personal rule of thumb:  * Higher skirt = higher shaft, longer skirt = lower shaft. Basically, ankle boots with ankle-length skirts, knee-high boots or thigh-high boots with miniskirts. * I include a contrasting-color knee sock as "the shaft," so a knee-high boot with a miniskirt is equivalent to an ankle boot plus knee-high socks with a miniskirt. * I sometimes layer tights with knee socks/thigh-highs or just wear the socks alone, and if the socks are calling attention to themselves (either by color or pattern), I wear them with ankle boots to show off the socks.	episode_done:True

text:MFA Brand MegaReview: Camoshita | January 23, 2021	labels:I love Camoshita and look forward to the new seasons every year. I've never handled a piece from the brand that wasn't perfectly executed and ultra comfortable. I don't wear a lot of suiting, but I've had some of their shirts and outerwear on heavy rotation for years.	episode_done:True
text:Overhauling my wardrobe with lasting pieces	labels:People may turn their noses up at Banana Republic but I think they offer great value especially if you are a tall fellow. They have a 50 percent off sale quarterly and you could easily overhaul your wardrobe for like less than 500 bucks. They definitely lean more classic/conservative. You aren‚Äôt going to be turning heads but you won‚Äôt be out of style either. Longevity is probably the only thing you need to be wary of. Their denim, chinos and jackets have been good for me, but their knitwear is hit or miss.
text:I second this recommendation for OP.  Banana Republic is my go-to for exactly three things: Inoffensive winter basics, chinos, and short-sleeve prints (because for some bizarre reason, they're great at them). When I say winter basics, I mean solid-color sweaters/cardigans/pullovers. BR hits an amazing value proposition when their stuff is on sale.   Not sure any of it will last 10 years, but I don't think that's a realistic expectation for any clothing except suits.	labels:You make a great point about short-sleeve prints. Definitely an unexpected strength of theirs. I do have a few of their sweaters, which I generally like, but their new merino blend is not for me. It‚Äôs softer/more luxurious feeling but seems less durable. Whether it is or not, I don‚Äôt know. I would just opt for heavier woven sweaters personally.
text:The oversupply of Merino wool is definitely not being used well by low-to-mall-tier brands. They're treating it like a softening agent instead of the star of the show. Best to look at brands who already do good Merino sweaters and buy there.	labels:Interesting, I didn‚Äôt know that. Who would you recommend?
text:Honestly, I don't know. I went to the mall a couple weeks ago and was let down by most of the sweaters I saw. It's the same thing you observed... Everything felt flimsy. For reference, I stopped in Target, Macy's, Banana Republic, Nordstrom's and Bloomingdales. Bloomingdales/Nordstrom's had some stuff I would consider, but the prices were commensurate with high-end brands, so ~$150-200 for jumpers and turtlenecks.  Edit: Correcting myself here... $150-200 is more like mid-tier all things considered.	labels:I know what you mean. A lot of the sweaters I‚Äôve been trying these days feel more like ‚Äúdress‚Äù sweaters than everyday wear. And yeah I certainly wouldn‚Äôt pay full price for any of those upper-mid tier brands. On sale they are good value but otherwise I‚Äôm not so sure.	episode_done:True
text:How do you guys find your style if you can‚Äôt try on clothes due to COVID?	labels:Little Old Lady here.  Comment on another post called my style "artsy androgynous".  No hand me downs (LOVED them when I was in a position to get!!), but graphic tees/denim shirts/flannels/hoodies/jeans/cargoes.  Never aimed for a style my whole life I don't think, but this is how I ended up, clean, warm/cool, comfortable.	episode_done:True
text:what pieces/brands did you buy when moving from a warmer climate to a cooler climate? what did you end up regretting/not using?	labels:Many years ago I moved from Hawaii to college in the Northeast. I would recommend 1) Buying it all there, because they'll have what's good for their climate and 2) starting out with cheaper options (thrifted, Old Navy, Target range) even if it's not quite your style. Don't spend much time, effort, and money until you see how you really feel after at least a year of seasons. Maybe you want warmer stuff than you thought you would, or realize you should invest in nicer socks, or discover you don't actually like turtlenecks, or shift to a different style when you're surrounded by a new area's vibe. Let yourself experience it for a bit without pressuring yourself to do it all right.

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE!- October 31	labels:I am planning to buy a new pair of boots. Six Eyelets, no toe cap, looks rather clean. I like that look.  Just before pulling the trigger, I noticed that there are 2 colors. **Chocolate Brown** and **Burgundy**. I now froze and cannot make a decision.  So here's what I got:  * I rarely wear a suit. But I will be wearing the boots with a Medium Blue or Navy Suit. * I am a minimalist with two pairs of black skinny jeans. My shirts are all Navy Blue or Black. One exception is an oxford shirt with Army Green color (no patterns, I am boring). * I got two winter jackets. One is leather, chocolate color. The other is very dark navy blue, almost black.  Which color do I get? I will have to buy a matching leather belt either way.  * If I get the Burgundy, I will have to change my two skinny jeans into Gray. But will the Burgundy shoes match well with my chocolate leather jacket? The leather jacket is my only concern if I choose the Burgundy boots.   Otherwise, I am leaning towards Burgundy.	episode_done:True

text:+J/UNIQLO SPECIAL COLLABORATION: What‚Äôs the verdict?	labels:I got the silk turtleneck is grey and black. I never see turtlenecks made of 100% silk so it intrigued me. The material is very thin as expected with silk so I skipped the white one. The standout of the silk knits would be the grey. The grey has a nice sheen to it and looks so luxe compared to a regular cotton turtleneck. They are so soft and warm and I can see myself wearing them for many years. I also got the double breasted wool coat in black. I had no intention of buying this but decided to try it on. I am a short gyal and this coat fit me so well I snatched it up right away. I was in the market for a new coat but was thinking of buying an Aritzia one but this one fit me much better. The thing I noticed with this coat is that the arms are cut in a way that it curves with the way that your arms fall on your body. It also has two inside pockets. I‚Äôm very impressed! I also tried the cashmere coats but I didn‚Äôt like those as much as I wanted something with a little more weight and more structured.
text:I‚Äôm wishing i had those turtlenecks!!! I am a short gyal as well. Surprised to hear you found the coat fit you well. I‚Äôve been hearing that the collection is generally oversized	labels:I am a fan of oversized clothing so that may be why! When people mention that something is too oversized I tend to think that it fits perfectly oversized. It is wider but it‚Äôs not too long so it doesn‚Äôt overwhelm my frame. A lot of the long oversized coats that hit the top of my ankles tend to wear me and not the other way around.	episode_done:True

text:What are your favorite outfits to wear with white booties?	labels:White boots go well with patterned dresses!

The thing is, both my bff and I are massively into bags, yet MV was virtually unknown back then... and we are both Italian.

text:Any advice for overcoming self consciousness/self doubt when you're trying to step out of your comfort zone and expand your style?	labels:The beauty with fashion is that there are so many middle grounds! To venture out of your comfort zone, some ideas are:  - Wear kitten heels or pretty pumps instead of boots. Practically speaking, they'll also be more comfy than stilettos  - Try to incorporate one item of pattern or bold colour which you like into your wardrobe. Plan ahead and style it in different ways with your existing wardrobe, according to different  circumstances (e.g. casual lunch, work day, nice dinner out), and wear it when you get the chance  - Stop thinking too much about what others think and try to identify what looks and things you like instead.   - I prefer to dress for the occasion (e.g. it'd be silly to wear a little black dress with heels if I'm going for a countryside visit), but you can still look nice doing so for whatever event! In the countryside example, I would dig out some nice cable knit jumper paired with jeans, my Barbour and a lovely woollen scarf, plus chunky boots. Equally I could style that with a cute skirt instead of jeans if there's less climbing over stiles and more visits to village pubs and quaint coffee shops. (Not that there's any chance to do the above anytime soon. #bloodyCovid)	episode_done:True
text:People who built your wardrobe consciously from scratch - what were your strategies?	labels:This might not be helpful at all, but here‚Äôs how it worked out for me:  My first realization was that (for me) basics are overrated. I only like certain types of pants and never wear basic, plain tees. So I got enough skinnie jeans to last me throughout the week (which is 3 in my case) - two in black, one in a timeless jeans shade. Then I got just enough lounge/sleepwear to last me between washes. I had a small handful of old sweaters and tees that I didn‚Äôt love and phased out (still keeping them around for yard work) when I got items I loved.  From here on I decied to take it slow and *only* get pieces that   a) worke with what I have, and b) genuinely excite me.  In my case that meant (second hand) designer pieces that I meticulously picked out.  They needed to be timeless, of high enough quality to last years, fit me and suit me, and reasonable to care for. (Learning how to properly care for your clothes goes hand in hand with that)  If I saw something I loved (for example an 80s Fendi monogram jeans skirt, a lovely navy blue N. Pearl men‚Äôs turtleneck that looks just the right kind of oversized on me) I‚Äôd jump at it, otherwise I made due with what I had.  I slowly built my wardrobe like that. I only purchased 2-3 pieces a month and was really really picky. I either bought outstanding ‚Äúwow‚Äù-pieces, or items I *really* needed at the time (a winter coat for example).   While I don‚Äôt have a large variety of clothes to pick from, I‚Äôm genuinely excited to get dressed every day.	episode_done:True
text:Learning about technical side of clothes - fabrics, care, quality etc.	labels:I think a lot of people here that say their clothing falls apart quickly aren't properly caring for their clothes. Growing up I learned to wash everything together on cold. As an adult I had to read articles and watch YouTube videos on how to care for my clothing. I recommend everyone learn how to properly launder their clothing.
text:I've done my laundry for 20 years, using laundry bags, special detergent, gentle cycling. Silk, cashmere, underwire bras (REALLY use the bag here), sneakers it's all fine! Just dry on a flat surface.  I usually have no problem until cotton tshirts the last couple of years. A cotton tshirt should be fine at 40^o C. It's the recommendation on the label. But a few has instantly lost inches in high and transfererad it to width. And it's a ridiculous difference. All my husbands tshirts are fine though, it's only mine getting ruined.	labels:> But a few has instantly lost inches in high and transfererad it to width.   I think that's an issue with construction.

text:When to start saving clothes for your children?	labels:I'm in a similar situation as yourself. The way I think of it,  I save the clothes that I absolutely love in a small box. That way, regardless of if I have kids or not, I will have a curated box of my favorite pieces that I can look back on in time and think, "wow, I'm so happy I saved this." It's a little tedious, seeing as you will be hauling around a box for years, but if you take the approach of a museum curator, the old pieces can resemble pictures in a photo album, as opposed to clothing to be worn.

I might start to wear bracelets again and go from there.
text:I've been slowly building a collection of jewelry (mostly rings) and I think the trick is to have a couple of things minimum at all times. Wearing just one ring or bracelet alone feels a bit off to me, and I found that people challenged me less when I wore a couple of items as opposed to one.   At least, they stopped asking me if I was getting married any time soon.	labels:Yes totally. And at least to me it feels like you planned it and you know exactly what you're doing. It's looks intentional. Like you're pulling it off and you know it.	episode_done:True
text:FAQ: When shopping on a budget, what items have the highest point at which they reach diminishing returns?	labels:In my experience, lower quality at lower price points is most noticeable for outerwear, footwear, or knits (I guess because they all serve a functional purpose) and spending more tends to lead to a more noticeable improvement in quality up to a certain point. That's painting with a broad brush though... leather dress shoes and boots scale much better than sneakers or sandals, where mid-range options are going to be good enough for most people.  T-shirts, dress shirts, denim, and accessories in low-to-mid-range are generally good enough from a quality perspective IMO and I've only really paid more in those categories for a design I like rather than because I think I'm getting something higher quality. There's nothing wrong IMO with buying something because you like the way it looks even if a similar quality alternative exists at a lower price, but that's harder to do if you're shopping on a budget.  I'll also add that for all of the above, your dollar goes a lot farther if you're willing to shop used. Sites like Ebay, Grailed, reddit/styleforum B/S/T threads, etc. have made it a lot easier to buy preowned clothes without having to set foot into a thrift store.  TL;DR When shopping on a budget I'd focus first on having a high quality pair of shoes and jacket. Consider buying used clothes to stretch your budget further.
text: >TL;DR When shopping on a budget I'd focus first on having a high quality pair of shoes and jacket. Consider buying used clothes to stretch your budget further  I volunteer in a charity shop (thrift store/op shop etc) and good coats, jackets and shoes come in *all the time*. Men either look after their clothes or destroy them. Womenswear tends to be more "worn but wearable" (but we easily get five times as much of it donated).   Shop in a slightly more affluent area and you'll find nicer things. Quite often there are a few shops catering to different markets and people (subconsciously?) donate according.   I've got a 1970s sheepskin coat from a charity shop that I'm expecting to last another 50 years at least and a pair of Timberland books that I bought for the change in my pocket eight years ago - they just needed new insoles.	labels:Just to piggyback on this, Timberland quality is shockingly bad these days.

text:Anyone else feeling incredibly disconnected from the 'fashion world'?	labels:I live in France and there is definitely a big push on instagram via influencers for 'nouvelle vague' 60s-70 styles to be promoted as 'french/parisienne girl style' even though that is not actually what most French women wear,  but it is a style category that exists here. I like certain elements of this style but there are intellectual experts in recent years that have shown that the marketing push of this image nationally and internationally had lead to a lot of erasure of the diversity of French population. Luckily more and more media outlets are trying to show the diversity of French style. I love 'Dress Like A Parisian' blog that really instills how stylish french women create their style no matter what kind style 'identity' they gravitate to.  As for sources on instagram/pinterest etc. I have several: In terms of RTW,  I'm not the biggest fan of Hedi Slimane but his Celine collections since 2019 are very wearable and what I could see certain French demographics wearing. And I mine older Isabel Marant (pre 2015-2016) for inspiration to satisfy my bohemian itch. Other RTW I like is Dries Van Noten, Chlo√©, Old C√©line, Virginie Viard's Chanel. On instagram, I follow certain hashtags of certain brands (typically high mid-end/independent designers many of them French)  to see how smaller influencers style certain brands.  Concept stores/Large mulit-brand boutiques also do a great job on insta with styling which helps me hone in my style. I still use Pinterest but it's easy to keep seeing the same pins to repin and it ruins the search for inspiration so I like mine instagram more and more often.	episode_done:True
text:Is fast fashion really fast fashion if you get years of use out of the garments?	labels:> So where does that leave the consumer who has a closet full of items purchased at fast fashion retailers, but rarely makes new purchases and many of their current pieces have remained in their closet for years?   If you already have a closet full of fast fashion, taking good care of it and using it for as long as possible is the most ethical choice.  I'm in the same boat.  I'm doing a year of no new clothes/shoes purchases (only thrifted/poshmark) and I'm trying to only get things that are high quality and will last, even if they are used.    Most of these online clothing boutiques (at least the ones I see on Poshmark/Facebook/Instagram are not sourcing ethically produced items.  I'm sure there are some that are, but they all seem to have the same stuff and you can tell just from the photos that it's cheaply made.  Again, I haven't seen every online boutique there is so I'm sure there are some out there that are fine.	episode_done:True

Example, Closet 1: sizes 4-6 closet 2: sizes 8-10 and closet 3: sizes 12-14 and have truly just the basics in each closet (t‚Äôs, button ups, jeans, a jacket so on...) and then have a few ‚Äústatement‚Äù pieces in each closet you know will look good on your body and make you feel good in that particular size range.    Depending on how minimal you want to be you could have at the minimum, 8-10 pieces in each ‚Äúcloset‚Äù (black and white T shirt, two jeans, two button ups, a couple of sweaters and 1-2 statement pieces.  With all three closets maybe 30 items?).  You could have accessories (purses, scarves, jewelry and shoes) that would always fit with each closet as well, which you probably already have.  Hope this helps!	episode_done:True
text:Creative pragmatism light	labels:This style is surprisingly attainable for me after several years of hardcore minimalism. Once I got to a place where my basics are both on point and super pragmatic, then I have been able to incorporate a few Tibi and Tibi-like statement pieces into my rotation. I‚Äôm no longer a minimalist in terms of style - I like buying a couple ‚Äúbig impact‚Äù things every year to jazz up my clothes, especially oversized  or dramatic drape or ‚Äúorigami structure‚Äù on tops and coats. A single piece really changes an outfit and you don‚Äôt need many pieces in rotation to suddenly change your style. Amy Smilovic appears to do a similar thing - keep several things ‚Äúbasic‚Äù (neutral color, solid/no pattern, uniform texture, unadorned (no bling or fringes etc) and the play with one thing (her thing seems to be oversized fit and pleats).  The only reason I bring up minimalism is because I cannot emphasize more how much the basics being ‚Äújust right‚Äù makes my dramatic pieces work. Especially with oversized, it‚Äôs a thin line between slob and stylish. Those big pleated dad pants Amy Smilovic wears? The rest of the outfit should be sharp or you look like you simply don‚Äôt know how clothes should fit. Not everyone needs to first develop an ‚Äúunfashionable‚Äù base before reaching for both fashionable and pragmatic, but I did.   As for Tibi, I know them most for silks and for their origami shapes. GoSilk is a great option for patterned silk and Roksanda has the shapes. Ganni and Comme Les Garcons has some of the quirkinesses and oversized looks. But none of them are cheap either unless you score a good sale. If you can identify exactly what you like about Tibi, we can make more recommendations.
text:Thank you for this thoughtful and helpful answer! I come from the opposite end, full closet, constantly shifting from boho to grunge and then to sporty again until I was fed up with the whole "I don't know what to wear" thing - I never understood what exactly I liked about a clothing piece or style.  I ended up with some good quality basic pieces, not boring, functional, versatile and now I try to build from there. What I am really looking for are clothing pieces, in which an idea, a thought was invested - meaning there is something deliberate about it, interesting cut, texture, print. But I also want them to work together with other things I own.   Thank you for recommending Gianni and Comme des Garcons, I have some things from them and they are more affordable for me. I also like COS for good fabrics and robustness, but then again it is quite popular where I live and many people shop there too. Arket is even cheaper, but it is a little bland for me. There are also some european brands like Closed or Baum und Pferdgarten, Essentiel Antwerp, however it always depends on a particular season/trend whether I find something there or not.	labels:> Baum und Pferdgarten  Ohhh I love them, my local boutique has finally started carrying this and it‚Äôs so fun!	episode_done:True
text:General Discussion - October 20	labels:Not sure how many of you know this, but at this point when you write a job application for a teaching position, you have to use the words "diversity" and "inclusion" in basically every second sentence of your entire application dossier (and academic dossiers are *long*).  I'm *this* close to writing something like "I dress really gay".

Anyway, I hope you enjoy this video and see why I'm falling more and more in love with the New Balance 99x series.

Where did you get those shoe racks?	labels:Awesome choice, haha I'd get a pair myself if I didn't have these 993s.   I got the shoe racks from Amazon!

text:When/why did you get your first really fancy purse/bag?	labels:I got my first fancy bag after calling off my wedding lol I figured it cost around the same amount as the dress I wouldn‚Äôt ever wear so why not? The woman at the LV store thought I was on drugs ... ‚Äúare you celebrating something?‚Äù And I‚Äôm like as a matter of fact, yes, yes I am. I just lost a ton of money on a wedding but I dodged a bullet and left that POS. All she said was ‚Äúwell you can always make more money‚Äù anyway, I‚Äôm getting a Chanel bag for my next milestone birthday. Not sure which one but it‚Äôs gonna happen soon.

text:Have you ever found a designer, maker or collection that makes you seriously think, "Everything they make is so beautiful and I want to own/collect everything they make?" If so, what is it?	labels:I think it's so cute and funny how much people's tastes differ.  I like a lot of free people stuff, rat and boa, reformation, various dollskill stuff for things that are more affordable.   I also love stuff by Alberta feretti, bottega Venetta, Rick Owens and red kawabuko. I'm terrible at remembering new designers bc there are so many but a lot of English and Japanese designers are so far beyond what current fashion is its mind boggling.	episode_done:True

What you can do is not support them.  The fashion *blog* alone will not survive. The future is social media. That's unfortunate as I don't really care much about social media.

text:How do you guys who like a formal/business look manage to not look the same all the time?	labels:Alright, since a lot of people already have commented great ways to style formal/business attire.   For style reference, look up Lydia Pang (lydia\_pang\_) on IG. She has a highlight that is dedicated to her outfits. She's my style icon so maybe I'm biased. I don't know if you intend to wear THAT much black, but her sense of style is out of this world for business and casual. She makes formal attire a bit more fun and quirky while still being professional.

text:Is anyone dressing up this year for Halloween?	labels:I‚Äôll be Princess Leia (again). I have a great costume from a work Star Wars event that I look forward to wearing.   My older daughter is 7, so candy is a must. We‚Äôre not going to trick or treat this year, but we‚Äôll meet up with kids from her class at our local park and do some Halloween activities and give out candy. We‚Äôre really lucky to have nice weather today when it‚Äôs often pouring rain.
text:I am curious to find out if anyone WILL come to my house this year. I will have candy out just in case.  I LOVE Star Wars and went as Leia one year. Complete with the hairdo LOL   Hope you and your family get to enjoy the day. So awesome that you have great weather. It is gloomy, cold, and windy here in MN today.	labels:The hairdo is the best part!  Thanks! Hope you enjoy your Halloween too!
text:It really is!!     I have a friend that has a Chewy costume. The whole thing. I wonder if he is going out in it. He always says it is so nice and warm being outside in the MN fall on Halloween LOL	labels:	episode_done:True
text:If money were no object? Bespoke or haute couture?	labels:In this hypothetical I'd go with haute couture. In your friend's situation I'd keep looking until I found a designer I liked. Bespoke would be my last option for a couple of reasons. Your friend wants contemporary fashion, but most bespoke tailors make traditional clothes for a typically older crowd (you're in NYC though so there are some bespoke tailors catering to a younger crowd; make sure you look for them specifically). The bespoke tailors catering to a younger crowd don't have designs as good as high end ready to wear IMO. Tailoring and designing are different skills, and there's a reason Louis Vuittion, YSL, Dior, Gucci, etc pay their head designers millions per year. Of course some $4000 coats are worth more than others, so it would be good to know a bit about general quality.  Personally, I prioritize design over fit. I can deal with a less than perfect fit if I love the design of a piece. But I won't wear a piece if I don't love the design, even if it fits well.   The middle ground option is made to measure, or MTM. MTM for outerwear isn't as common for suiting, but it's out there.
text:These are all valid points and I appreciate your perspective on this. I totally value the integrity of top designers of HC labels as well. There are some incredible designs from YSL and Gucci that I would splurge on, even if the fit wasn't 100% what I wanted it to be.  The reality is though, that there are several body structures and only 1 final product, which doesn't capture all of those body builds, and that's the struggle with HC.  I genuinely think it's only a matter of time before traditional bespoke tailors move into goods that are more commonplace - t-shirts, sweaters, etc. - and most of these designers are quite good at their respective crafts.  I've interviewed many of these emerging designers/tailors myself, specifically Mike Paul, who is based in Toronto. He is moving into bespoke tailoring across multiple verticals. His story is pretty cool too. If anyone wants to hear it, DM me and I'll throw the link to the pod episode.  There's also another designer in Toronto that does bespoke jeans.  So, there are definitely designers who have identified the need in the market.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Women with ADHD & Sensory Processing Disorder: I need Clothing recs!	labels:Whoa... I am an adult woman with ADHD and I never thought about this somehow. I have MAJOR issues with restrictive clothing. Winter coats feel like a straitjacket, turtlenecks \*literally\* made me vomit when I was younger, and anything that's even slightly itchy or makes a weird noise (like a swishy windbreaker) drives me insane. I can't wear bracelets or watches because the sound of them clicking on my desk grates against my soul.  I usually live in American Eagle jeggings (soft joggers as soon as I get home), comfortable shirts, soft and loose sweaters/cardigans, comfortable ankle boots/Converse, and sometimes a well-fitting skirt with tights.  Interestingly, I have no issue with wearing tights, which I know a lot of women find uncomfortable. I don't mind wearing a bra, either.

text:I know ‚Äúfashion‚Äù but people of minorities are always forced to try better. Some Insights	labels:As a black man I'm not surprised by this at all. I don't think I'm as affected as most because my clothes are overtly fashionable and often feminine, and that tends to disarm any preconceptions of "dangerous" and "violent". But I see it all the time, and I do notice a difference on the rare occasions I just dress plainly. Before Covid, if I walked home from the gym at night in sweats I wouldn't put my hood up or my hands in my pockets because I walked by one of campus police's favorite sitting spots. We only need to look at Trayvon Martin for confirmation. One note about the study:  > While it is tempting to tell individuals that how they dress can evoke negative biases, this avoids addressing a bigger issue ‚Ä¶ In fact, directing individuals to change what they wear places the burden of mitigating stereotypes and associated prejudices on the wearer. Instead, we need to consider how we can change the perceptions of those who hold and use such stereotypes in harmful ways.  I agree and I appreciate the sentiment, but I'll be dead before we change racists' perceptions on this. It's not a burden I or any other black man should have to carry, but realistically it's a lot easier for me to change my clothes than for a racist to change their thinking.  ETA: Black women have it way worse. They get to have racism **and** misogyny!

text:How to build a style with a limited outlet?	labels:I almost exclusively online shop. I wouldn't say that I am a trend setter or anything, but it is so much easier to look at photos online of people who have the same body shape as me whose fashion I admire, compare those photos to what I have in my closet, and purchase what is missing to make the outfit work all in one place. It sounds like a lot, but I find this so much easier, less anxiety-inducing, and less time consuming than brick-and-mortar shopping. Plus, usually returns are just a drop off somewhere with a digital reciept rather than waiting is line at a customer service counter with a paper receipt that I have lost twice, ripped, and had to tape back together. A little tidbit: the biggest trick to online shopping is to KNOW YOUR MEASUREMENTS!!! A cheap measuring tape works wonders.	episode_done:True

I didn‚Äôt grow up seeing anyone in my family or circles wearing well-tailored clothing or professional attire in general so i genuinely don‚Äôt know what a good fit looks like. I struggle a lot with having a curvier body and a loud personality but not wanting to feel like a pinup girl caricature if my clothes are too tight or fit a certain way. I‚Äôve never really thought about what i would and wouldn‚Äôt consider a good fit on me, besides my Levi‚Äôs 721s. I really need to have myself a think on this!	episode_done:True

text:For those who define their style as "classic-traditional" (tailored, fitted, matching, sleek), what are your typical outfits for work, on the weekends, date-night, running errands or lounging around?	labels:For work at this point I‚Äôll throw a white button down over some yoga pants, it looks good enough for zoom and isn‚Äôt bad overall. White button-downs are basically a personal staple at this point. For running errands or running around I‚Äôll do a fitted white oxford button down with high waisted linen pants or something A-line, with a leather handbag or backpack, or a tan tote. Maybe a long coat/trench coat if it‚Äôs cold or raining. For lounging around I‚Äôll probably wear a cardigan, sweater layered on a button down, or something else cozy. I‚Äôve gotten a lot of inspiration from Pinterest and the ‚Äúdark academia‚Äù aesthetic :)	episode_done:True

text:Is anyone into MBTI? Do you feel like your fashion preferences align with your personality type?	labels:INFP here! I buy everything second hand, so my wardrobe is a collection of every style and era. I love wearing things that have had a past life before me, and I'm supporting the second hand industry by doing so too.  In less abstract terms, my wardrobe tends to be quite eclectic. Most of my clothes are from the 80s/90s, but I do like to switch it up. Because it's all second hand, my trendy pieces will usually be the older version of a trend! Eg. having mom jeans and floral midi skirts from the 80s, or bootcut jeans from the 00s.  I find it important that my fashion choices reflect my personality, or current mood. For inspiration, I often spend hours looking at old photographs/movies/etc and imagining what these characters would have worn from my wardrobe. Sometimes I'm feeling Britney Spears circa 1999, but other times I want to be a slightly-bohemian period drama character, so I can dress accordingly. I like to have a wardrobe where items can do double duty.  I often feel like I don't know how to express myself, so I love how clothes are a way of easily doing it! That's possibly the most INFP sentence I've ever said, lol.
text:Im ENFP and "my wardrobe is a collection of every style and era" --- so this!

text:What work for my boyfriends taste and body type?	labels:Photos and a budget would help.  Layering can be good, especially for a guy with a broad frame like you're describing.  If he wants more Americana, he can try westernwear (denim, flannel shirts, chambray shirts in the summer, rugged leathers). Flannels can be worn open over a tee shirt as a very casual midlayer, or buttoned up as you might expect.  On the smarter end, he might be interested in Ivy / Prep. That will include oxford cloth shirts with button down collars (a "university stripe" in blue is a good start), tassel loafers (a Brooks Brothers original), khaki chinos (overrated), and a navy blazer.  I can give more specific recommendations if you give us an idea of your budget.	episode_done:True

text:How do you guys who like a formal/business look manage to not look the same all the time?	labels:If you don‚Äôt like to switch up colors or silhouettes, how about switching up textures? Silk turtlenecks, velvet dressy pants, boucle jackets, etc?
text:I agree here - if what you like is the silhouette, switch up color.  If what you like is the color, switch up silhouette.  If you can't part with both (i.e., black/gray, dressy pants and turtlenecks everyday), go for textures/materials - I have a charcoal cardigan with black leather pockets that's so fun.  One final thought: outerwear	labels:Thanks so much for adding to that!!  And outerwear oof i feel bad - I own two coats and I love them both dearly, they‚Äôre basically the same fancy coat, but one in black and one in tan. If my outfits are repetitive let‚Äôs not talk about mh outerwear!
text:Lol well at least you know what you like.  I went through a blazer phase and have the same blazer in like 10 colors but I realized I wasnt wearing them during the pandemic so I sold off a few.  But that's another option!	labels:Totally sounds like something I‚Äôd do! What‚Äôs a good blazer you recommend? I like me a good blazer haha
text:Ah sorry for the delayed response!!  I was really into Kensie Rebekah Crepe blazers (with satin lining) for a while - they are pretty comfy and come in a ton of fun colors, but some of them looked cheaper than others and I just couldn't put my finger on why other than that perhaps the fabric content wasn't identical with some of the colors, causing some to pile more easily than the others.  I ended up selling a few on poshmark.  I really like the drape and fit of NY&C Ponte/Sweater blazers - they have a longer length than the Kensie ones and feel more casual prep than the Kensie ones - and they are super versatile and comfy, but they have enough structure to feel professional.  I wish I could find more of them but they seem not be sold too often at the official site so I rely on Poshmark - I have one in black and also a heathered tan/oatmeal color.  I have recently gotten into these relaxed/cardigan type blazers that I got through Stitch Fix - FrenchMauve Melanie Knit Tunic Blazer and Skies Are Blue Hannah Modal Scuba Blazer are really comfortable.  They have a similar long length as the NY&C ones but are much less structured - they are more flexible/thinner and feel like a dressed up cardigan that's a tad less professional.  J. Crew also has some nice sweater blazers but it's a bit of a hit or miss for me on fit/cut/drape - good structure though!!	labels:	episode_done:True

text:How do you actually incorporate colour in your wardrobe?	labels:I hopped on r/coloranalysis and got an idea of my palette. I‚Äôve been able to add a few sweaters/tops into my rotation that I feel confident look good against my skin tone. It has definitely helped me dip my toes into wearing more color and feeling confident doing so! Before I had an idea of what colors actually worked, I felt uncomfortable buying/wearing color.  I didn‚Äôt really think adding an accessory in a color helped me feel more comfortable. Understanding color theory a little more wrt how it works on my own coloring felt more intentional in my opinion, then I just went for adding a few tops.	episode_done:True
text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - December 11, 2020	labels: What are some good casual boots for $200-ish or less?  Looking to get my brother some boots for Christmas. He's 30 years old, and I'd describe his style as somewhere about halfway between basic-bro and hipster. Red Wings Heritage line would be perfect, but I don't know if I can swing $300.  Any less expensive alternatives? Around $200 or less would be great. He lives in Colorado - so they'll need decent tread for snow and such. Thanks in advance!

Not sure how it feel about the fits with vests over a sportscoat/jacket. Especially with the jacket lapel pulled up and over the vest.
text:>Not sure how it feel about the fits with vests over a sportscoat/jacket. Especially with the jacket lapel pulled up and over the vest.  A guy I know said he did this this weekend.

I don't hate it.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:How do I figure out my "style"?	labels:Your ‚Äústyle‚Äù is basically what you are comfortable in. If you are not comfortable browsing the mall for hours then it‚Äôs obviously not your thing. Although what we wear do play a factor in how people perceive us we cant really let that affect our style, because at the end of the day literally everyone has their own opinion and you cant make everyone happy. You can only make yourself happy so do whats best for you. Other than that if you do want to experiment with various aesthetics but Don‚Äôt wanna spend time at the mall just shop online, or maybe try thrifting (just give everything a wash first).	episode_done:True
text:Hand wash only clothes	labels:I think that this really depends on what type of washing machine you have access to. If you have a modern, front loading machine, with multiple wash settings, you can relatively easily machine wash many ‚Äúhand wash only‚Äù items. I‚Äôve had varying results with top loaders or old front loading washers-I find them more rough on clothes. Most items do ok on a delicates cycle with cold water for both stages. I often wash sweaters on the wool setting (cold water, low spin) or soak my sweaters with euclean and spin dry-er in the machine before laying flat to dry. Most of the damage to clothes happens in the dryer IMO. Also, brands often put dry clean only or hand wash only because they haven‚Äôt tested the fabric for machine wash and want plausible deniability-thus many things can survive with machine wash cold and air dry. But your results may naturally vary based on the piece of clothing. I personally only buy stuff that I feel is very special that is not machine wash air dry safe. Otherwise I feel like laundry ends up taking too much of my life, and it isn‚Äôt worth it to me.
text:This. Every front loader I've ever used has had a hand wash cycle which just gently rocks the clothes in water and doesn't spin them.  I don't hand wash anything other than my face cloths and masks (simply because it's quicker).	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Become a Tailored Suit Pro - Guide	labels:If you're totally new to tailoring this is a okay start. For those of us further down our sartorial journeys (¬© Hugo Jacomet), this is woefully incomplete. I'm not sure how one reads this guide and emerges a "tailored suit pro." Very little of it meaningfully addresses how anything should fit and how to achieve an ideal fit through alterations. Also the section on suit construction and whether or not something is "designer" level is almost laughable.	episode_done:True

text:Andrew Marc New York Leather Jackets -- exploring the different "grades" of this brand	labels:What is Andrew Marc quality comparable to?
text:From my own experience, I'd say the best made "vintage" Andrew Marc leather jackets are better than a lot of "mall" brand leather jackets I've owned or tried like Kenneth Cole, Tommy Hilfiger, Reilly Olmes, Ralph Lauren Chaps. I have a Ralph Lauren POLO leather jacket (original MSRP $695) from 1999 made of a heavy leather that has held up wonderfully over the years and I'd say is better than the best Andrew Marc I've tried (but my experience is limited--there may be "gems" out there, like limited editions).	labels:90s Polo is kind of golden era polo, somewhat different to what we have 20 odd years later.      RL Polo iteration one happens in 67' , RRL comes in 93', and then Purple label is in 94', but over the years I think the gap in quality has really widened sadly.
text:Agreed. RRL has changed and isn't what it used to be. I've at least seen that with their jeans. I'd much rather pay less and pick up a lightly used pair from a decade ago rather than something new. I'm not familiar with their recent leather products, though.	labels:Interesting, I always hear RRL as the grail brand
text:Designs are grail, but honestly the feel is not that great for the money. It also feels kinda funny buying made in India/China stuff with purely American heritage designs for x2-x4 times the price of many other repro brands.  Not to say that designs don't absolutely rip. I love em, but I probably will always go with it's vintage counter part or another brand in general.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Can we make a thread of everyone posting their all time favorite Halloween costume they wore? üéÉüëª	labels:I love doing elaborate costumes from things I already have... I'm a bit of a hoarder so I actually have a lot of options! My last few costumes were Wednesday Addams, Holly Golightly, a witch, a pirate (2x), Old Gregg, and Jake (with Finn from Adventure Time). I only had to shop for the last two, buying a white necktie for Old Gregg and yellow shorts and shirt for Jake (because yellow is the ONE color I never wear).   I was looking forward to this Halloween for the last few years because it would finally be on a Saturday... I was thinking of going as Dorothy, as a German girl (I have a few dirndls), or as Cinderella and Belle with a friend (I have gowns and long gloves for both). Fingers crossed for next year!	episode_done:True

Had most of my cashmere sweaters getting on for twenty years now. Likewise my John Smedleys. Trousers made to measure have had for around fifteen years.
text:What brands do you recommend that are higher quality and can last longer?	labels:Here is a bunch of personal examples:  Norse Projects, A kind of Guise Red Wing boots, Asket, Aime Leon Dore, Ebbets Field Flannels, Mont St Michel, Portuguese Flannel, NN07  For example, I from Norse Projects I have a pair of Thomas Wool Flannel trousers and an Anton OCBD, both are like 7 years old and I wear them very regularly.

text:Matching shoes & purse	labels:I don‚Äôt think fashion has any rules anymore unless you‚Äôre royalty or it‚Äôs cultural.   I personally don‚Äôt like matchy matchy bag and shoes unless I‚Äôm going for a monochrome look. I tend to match tones rather than colours. I like a patterned bag (say Gucci dionysus or Fendi zucca or LV canvas) as opposed to patterned clothes because I find they blend in well with a variety of outfit choices.   If I do colour, I will make sure the tone matches. I can‚Äôt stand mixing warm times with cool tones. Eg I have a cool tone lilac paid of heels that I love wearing with my cool tone magenta bag.   You can also do opposite sides of the colour wheel with shoes and bags like a green bag and a purple/magenta pair of shoes. But again keep to the same tones. The key with fashion is the tone of colours, and that includes neutral colours too. I would always suggest everyone does a colour/tone analysis and then stick to buying items in that range. It makes mixing and matching easier.

text:Good suggestion! Thanks	labels:Also look at second hand/thrift shops/eBay. You can get some good deals without buying items you intend to get rid of later from AliExpress or similar. When you‚Äôre ready to upgrade (or if it‚Äôs not for you), just give it back to charity/thrift shop for them to sell on again.	episode_done:True

text:Are Luxury Fashion Brands Becoming Like Fast Fashion?	labels:Hm, I wonder if the same thing is happening there as has happened to so many other business sectors since the start of the MBA boom.   * Company has a fine, high quality product  * Consumers buy it on reputation * MBA comes in, cuts costs and quality * Consumers continue to buy assuming quality is the same * Profit margins up massively, MBA takes the opportunity to leave on a high note * Consumers finally realize it's garbage and stop buying * MBA already gutting the next brand  It's been happening everywhere the last few decades.
text:I think actually the issue is they went from being family owned private businesses to parts of conglomerates who are publicly traded. Growth is king. So they need to sell a lot more product or be more expensive or both to increase revenue and profits.  Luxury has become trend driven and decreasingly focused on craftsmanship to keep up with the quarterly numbers and growth targets.   Handbags, makeup, sunglasses, and perfume are very profitable and open the door to lower end customers.   The street wear trend is a boon because manufacturing and materials costs are very cheap, design needs are minimal, and it sells for a huge markup.	labels:>Family owned private businesses   Oh how this can come back.	episode_done:True
text:Purses: Real vs. Faux Leather?	labels:I can‚Äôt stand faux leather. Not for shoes, bags, clothes; anything. Plastic can start to degrade after some time (6-10 years). I had some faux leather hiking boots that turned to mush just sitting in their box in my closet. The handles on faux leather purses start to peel and the bottoms wear very fast. They simply do not hold up like leather.  I have vintage Dooney&Bourke leather bags that are 25+ years old. I keep them polished, clean and in dust bags when not in use and they look new.  If you can afford a genuine leather bag, even secondhand, it is the best choice imo.

Can't believe size XS actually works on me (normally medium in uniqlo stuff). Still has enough room to layer and somehow still has that oversized look. Amazed!  Also, after about 6 months of wear, I can confidently say the Auralee seamless tee is my favourite one that I own. I immediately knew it was gonna be my favourite as soon as I received it but I wanted to see how it was after many wears. One of the best features about it is that it's so soft but still drapes so nicely. And any wrinkle it develops after being folded in the closet basically straightens itself out after being worn for about 10 minutes. Shit! now i'm looking for more in different colors. A bit expensive at retail price but I've seen them on sale for around $50 which is doable for me.	episode_done:True

They vetoed me posting pictures (we have public facing jobs, these pictures are all over social media, too easy to reverse image search etc.), but they wore a Rick Owens dress (that I picked out) while I went full minimalism with a collarless shirt with onyx studs, a sleek blazer and cropped trousers. I put this together from my existing wardrobe, since we didn't want to spend a lot. Covid measures made things a bit weird, but the court officer made a real effort into making it nice, which was great. (edit: just so nobody thinks we are totally irresponsible: it was literally just us at city hall, no guests, no party. We'll catch up with that after vaccination.)

Proudest moment was when a group of Japanese girls crowded behind me trying to figure out what brand it is.  When I still lugged a laptop and then some everywhere I was using it a lot. But  I‚Äôm not carrying as much anymore. I just need a tablet and a water bottle for which the Isar is overkill. It alone weighs more than both of these together.  So great bag with great design but specific use case. Smaller than your typical carryon but big for something to take everywhere.

Looking forward to never having to replace these black tights ever again.  I‚Äôve been in the market for a camel coat and black leather jacket for a couple years, but haven‚Äôt found the perfect one to pull the trigger on either yet.

If it‚Äôs a holiday or no one is in the office, I‚Äôll put on a button down that‚Äôs half tucked in with jeans and I‚Äôll wear ankle boots. I‚Äôve seen people show up in leather or suede jackets on Fridays, but they‚Äôre not wearing it the entire time indoors. Depending on your role, T-shirts under a blazer is fine.	episode_done:True

text:MFA Wearing Big Coats	labels:This season, I‚Äôm seeing a lot of people, from all walks of life, all genders, wearing plaid overcoats (I‚Äôm in NYC). Most that I see are grey, and the patterns are big and bold (as opposed to, say, micro-houndstooth) with a little bit of color splashed in. And ya know what? I totally dig it! Very cool. I‚Äôve got a few pretty low end overcoats (J Crew, Jos A Bank, Kenneth Cole) but my favorite has always been my plaid Hart Schaffner Marx. Now I can feel all zeitgeisty when I rock it down the block.	episode_done:True
text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - February 14, 2021	labels:I‚Äôm 26 and generally dress like an average dude. I want to have clothes that fit me, look great and that I can be comfortable in, but I still someone buy stuff a size too small or basically skate stuff.  I want to dress like an adult to help me feel a bit more like one. I‚Äôm 6‚Äô 160lbs, a little bit fit, tan skin, so I would ask for any recommendations for relatively inexpensive good quality: pants (Levi‚Äôs 511 or 514?), plain t‚Äôs or v-necks, and every day shoes.   I work in an office and the setting is very casual, sometimes I got to clients houses though and I would like to appear professional when usually I‚Äôm slumming it in some basic slim jeans, blank shirt, and jacket + hat. My shoes are some skate shoes that look pretty shabby. I could just use a solid template for how to dress without looking too flashy. I mean I want to dress nicely and have a sense of fashion, but and no offense, I don‚Äôt want to look like a douche. tbh I have no clue how tf to do that. I don‚Äôt know what looks good and what doesn‚Äôt. I look pretty meh I feel, just trying to better myself.	episode_done:True

text:Ellen McArthur Circular Economy Report: by 2029 Resale is expected to be bigger than Fast Fashion	labels:Eh, I'm pretty skeptical about claims that fast fashion will die down any time soon. Especially this claim that resale will overtake it. How will that happen? Resale depends on new items being purchased. If people aren't buying as many new items, the stock at resale will drop. And if a ton of people are buying resale, the prices on the good stuff will continue to go up and result in a lot of people buying fast fashion because it's cheaper.  Fast fashion may not be high quality or eco-friendly, but it's inexpensive and offers a lot of variety, and that's always going to be in demand. Fast fashion won't die out unless a lot of governments put in strict regulations on labor and pollution and whatnot.	episode_done:True

text:Derek Guy: The Crown‚Äôs ‚ÄòBalmoral Test‚Äô Barbours Are Not Just Jackets	labels:It's the one reason I can't stomach Barbour, the upper crust British association rankles. It's reflexive. I love other British producers, have Trickers (official shoemaker for the Prince of Wales no less), Cheaneys and a good chunk of my wardrobe is SEH Kelly but that landed gentry aesthetic from Barbour just doesn't sit. I'd say it's an Irish thing but there's no shortage of people walking around Dublin in Barbour and I even remember a period in the late 80's / 90s when wax jackets were all the rage in rural Mayo.
text:Any thoughts on Private White VC?	labels:I mean they sell clothes that would fall into the Barbour aesthetic, I wouldn't wear any of their wax pieces, but they also sell other beautiful classic pieces. I'd be all over their wool overcoats. Their vibe is more towards the permanent style crowd but with as much as I spend on clothes I can't really claim the working class hero angle. The Barbour thing is probably more rooted in not wanting to look like I'm emulating the British elite.	episode_done:True

text:I actually hate my Ruggable. I love the design, but it is horrible for a house with dogs that shed a lot. The only way I‚Äôve found to get hair out of the rug is to get down and scrape it with my hands. Since using the vacuum with the brush (which would normally loosen hair) separates it from the Velcro and causes it to wrinkle, it‚Äôs impossible. Also, the edges are always rolling up.   Ok, end rant!	labels:Yeah the edges roll up like crazy on mine. And they are so flat, like zero plush at all. I do really like their designs though.	episode_done:True
text:How do you tell when discounted items were never full price?	labels:It doesn't matter if they were sold at a higher price, plenty of crap is marked up regardless of quality.

In loungewear there's apparently four types with no middle ground: For mothers-formerly-known-as-women,  for girls, for seduction purposes only, and Jeff Lebowski.

text:People who've been working from home for most of 2020 - do you think your work style will change when you go back to the office (compared to your work wardrobe pre-lockdown)? If so, how?	labels:I have been working from home in sweatpants and leggings since March and will WFH until at least summer 2021.   I miss going to the office and feeling cute, and being seen by others. A woman I work with told me ‚Äòyou always have the cutest dresses‚Äô about a year ago and I absolutely loved hearing that. I‚Äôve learned in quarantine that I don‚Äôt dress for myself, I dress for other people.   I‚Äôll probably dress up a bit more when I can go back and wear more lipstick, since I‚Äôve been in comfy slouch mode for so long.
text:This so much!  I love getting compliments, and it's easier to complement "fun" things. If I show up in a blue dress with little birds on it, It will get compliments.   A much more stylish blouse and pants with killer heels? It will look great, but no one compliment the perfect black pants.  At home with a dark office and shitty camera, I wear knitted joggers and cardigans with tight tops, like heattech. I'm really happy about trading most sweatpants for knitted versions, even though it's mostly synthetics. I find my legs are sensitive to wool.	labels:	episode_done:True

It's not like I'm going to be attending any events anytime soon. But I miss getting dressed up for stuff. It's too cold to wear dresses just for grocery shopping.

text:The Queen‚Äôs Gambit Inspo Album	labels:She‚Äôs so beautiful and literally the epitome of classic elegance	episode_done:True
text:How have you changed your style and/or shopping habits after your body has changed?	labels:Mainstream fashion is so much more inclusive these days when it comes to plus and mid size women I don't think gaining weight really makes a difference in the majority of cases.  Women who carry some extra weight are no longer designated to day floral vomit and glo tunics, empire waists, shark hems, polyester and doleman sleeves.  They can wear crop tops, high waisted pants, athleisure, alternative fashion ect.  Even high fashion is coming around somewhat.   This is especially true in the USA where 70% of people carry extra weight.    I think the way you feel about your body is important when choosing clothes.  Many women think they look worse in fashionable and attractive clothes than they actually do.  When women feel insecure they often hide behind their clothes instead of using their clothes to express themselves.	episode_done:True

text:I made this effort a couple years ago and it was life changing. It started with me silently observing and thinking nice things about people, but then it turned into me telling total strangers they look baller and it just brings so much joy into the world.

text:How do you shop at TJ Maxx/Marshall‚Äôs?	labels:Short of getting a bit of insider info, I think the only way to really have success at those stores is to browse them at least once a week (probably twice).  My aunt tends to go every other day and finds some amazing stuff‚Ä¶because she goes *every other day*.  She says it doesn‚Äôt take her long because she‚Äôs so familiar with their stock, but it still seems exhausting to me.  (As opposed to spending three hours scrolling through Poshmark in bed every night‚Ä¶)
text:I worked at TJ Maxx over the summer and can attest to this. The people who found the best deals were regulars. Also, you just have to take the time to go through pretty much every item.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What do you think are the pieces of jewelry everyone should own?	labels:I used to follow the outfit challenges and posts on the blog Putting Me Together and I really like her approach - instead of specific items, it‚Äôs more like categories of items. Long drapey necklace. Statement necklace. Short necklace. Neutral dangly earrings. Statement earrings. Stuff like that! That way you can find what suits you within the category so it can be classic and something you will actually wear!

text:"Can people just hate fashion again" - Synecdoche When Talking about the "Industry" Discussion	labels:> Should spaces & industries for fashion lovers, clothes lovers, and people that have to wear clothes be completely separate?  I don‚Äôt think that any of these groups should be completely separate however I do find them all being lumped into the same spaces very frustrating as someone who does love fashion as a form of art and creativity.  I like harsh and blunt constructive criticism in pretty much all areas of life and I most certainly want it for my outfits as well. I want to hear what other fashion lovers and artists think of my colour choices, proportions, textures, fit, etc. and be able to refine those things and really flex my creative muscles when creating an outfit. Instead, many fashion spaces are dominated by ‚Äòyou do you hun!‚Äô and ‚Äòso long as you like it, that‚Äôs all that matters!‚Äô which is great for someone *who has to wear clothes* and doesn‚Äôt actually care about fashion but joins fashion spaces because they feel some obligation as a woman to care about it but... those spaces just become unhelpful and bland for those who really love fashion and want to get better at it.  I‚Äôve been an off and on follower of FFA for a few years and I feel like it‚Äôs definitely dominated by the ‚Äúpeople who wear clothes‚Äù group and unfortunately it limits the amount of critique that is acceptable to give.
text:I am firmly in the ‚Äúloves fashion as a form of art‚Äù group too	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Is anyone else intimidated by maximalism? I love it, but how do you do it?	labels:I wouldn't call myself a maximalist, but style theory is similar to any other artistic theory. When choosing how to combine pieces, always take into account the color, lines, patterns, and textures. From here, the aesthetic is completely up to the individual. For example, a maximalist may work within a certain color pallette and then intentionally incorporate a clashing accent. Pattern mixing might seem random, but the person may have taken into account the contrast between sharp lines and abstract patters. So I guess my answer is somewhere in the middle. It always takes A LOT of effort to make something look effortless. However once there are certain boundaries, it can feel effortless to put colors, patterns, and silhouettes together that make sense to the individual and are theoretically pleasing to the eye.
text:It‚Äôs very similar to the MCM movement and the rams study homes in that sense. You don‚Äôt expect it, but it works.   I dress a lot like the photos OP provided and I don‚Äôt find most of them especially eccentric?	labels:I agree, the photos are pretty tame. I can see where for the average person pairing that many different colors together and including big statement pieces could be intimidating, but generally the color palettes are straight forward. Pattern including pink, yellow, and orange on the dress, orange coat, pink shoes, etc. I think it's just using more colors where some would choose a neutral. And pairing a very dramatic silhouette with more subdued pieces.	episode_done:True
text:How to look elegant without looking old?	labels:It is a good thing you put the links of the instagrammers, because their looks was not what I imagined from the word "elegant".  They are thin and fit, likely with lots of cosmetic surgery and beauty treatments, one is very tall, they are all very "done". It is a look, and everybody do their own thing. Their look is very body conscious, very revealing, very showing off curves (in the right places since they are very thin.. Always explicitly sexy. It is indeed, maybe stereotypical very russian, or eastern european in general.  Some  observations about those looks and if you want to :  - keep shoes all pristine. High heels or sneakers or combat boots, but keep them as  pristine as possible.  - when in doubt, downsize clothes (this is against my regular advice, but this is a specific look).  - usually always showing one of legs/cleavage/midriff.  - very brand aware but you will find similar pieces everywhere starting from primark up...	episode_done:True

text:What was your "how in the name of all that is holy did this end up in a thrift store" find?	labels:It‚Äôs less about the value of the item and more about the stars aligning perfectly.  I wear a size 12-13W shoe, plus other things that make my feet really hard to fit, so I am used to buying formalwear to match the one maybe two pairs of formal shoes I own at any given time.  So when I was 17 and going to prom in 2006, my mom tried really hard to help me find shoes, any shoes, that were suitable. But we could only find casual flats or runners, and I realllly wanted to dress up nicely for the first real time in my life. So she said ‚Äúyou know what, let‚Äôs buy a dress and then we will just have to find a way.‚Äù  So I picked out a black and pale pink dress that just made me swoon, and I figured black heels would be easiest to find. Lol I was so young and stupid.  Anyway we searched high and low right up until the week of prom, we drove to the US from Canada and looked there and I still couldn‚Äôt find a pair of heels that fit enough to buy and I decided I‚Äôd just wear uncomfy like always and deal with it.   Then I randomly walked into a thrift store and saw on the shoe rack a pair of pink heels in the exact shade of pink on my dress, with black trim. Picked them up, size 12W. They fit like they were made for me.   Wore them until they broke three years ago.
text:I can somewhat relate. My mom wears an 11W. I grew up watching her struggle endlessly to find shoes. She‚Äôs also an avid thrifter. For some reason I‚Äôve long been better than her at spotting the one random pair of 11Ws in sight, whether thrift shop or regular store. Even since I moved out I find things for her regularly and mail them. (And send the bill.) I‚Äôll usually text her, but I know her style well enough that I‚Äôm comfortable buying stuff without her approval. I know I‚Äôve found several pairs she wears almost daily.	labels:Aww, you're a good daughter!	episode_done:True

text:How to wear nice casual clothes with a cotton allergy?	labels:Have you tried looking for clothing made out of hemp or linen? You can find casual tshirts and whatnot that are 100% hemp fabric. You can also find causal shoes that are hemp (i have an older pair of Adidas that are 100% hemp fabric uppers). Plenty made out of leather as well.  Do you have a budget for clothes? A lot of companies that use these alternative materials are considered "premium" brands and carry their price tags accordingly.
text:Hey thanks for the suggestion. Sorry, I should have clarified this but I'm also allergic to hemp, linen, wool, and a few more obscure fabrics.  I'm willing to pay as much as needed for this kind of "alternative material" jean.  Leather might be an option but I'm vegetarian so it would need to be vegan leather probably	labels:>Leather might be an option but I'm vegetarian so it would need to be vegan leather probably  Okay, so... leather's not an option.

text:Inspo Album: Vintage Wool Sweaters Need Good, Loving Homes	labels:As a born and raised Norwegian, now living in the UK, my love for wool jumpers is endless and my sadness is twofold. 1) I might be Norwegian, but I've also got extremely sensitive skin. Thus my heart may be set on wool, but my skin is absolutely not, unless it's very fine cashmere or particular blends. 2) When autumn comes my immediate reaction is "WEAR ALL THE WOOL JUMPERS", and then I remember I live in the south of England and it doesn't actually get that cold here, plus it always rains.   Neither of those points are going to keep me from now spending several hours looking at vintage wool jumpers online though.
text:Yeah I hear that and my heart does ache!  I have a wool Aran cable sweater that I love but it is indeed itchy AF.  I'm usually wearing long sleeves below it so don't feel it, but a lot of sweaters you'll have at least a little contact at the wrists and neck.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:How did you find your style/tips for a cohesive style	labels:Anuschka Rees does a great job of explaining how to merge styles in one wardrobe:  ‚ÄúIf you think about it, a style is nothing but a set of individual elements. To merge two different aesthetics, you need to break them up into their elements, carefully select exactly which of these you want to incorporate into your own style concept, and then figure out how to turn them into actual outfits.   *As a first step, you need to ask yourself which exact elements‚Äîcolors, shapes, textures, specific pieces, details, and so on‚Äîof those two styles you want to be a part of your own unique look.* By doing this, you are reducing those big, restrictive top-level concepts into a simple set of tangible elements that are much easier to work with.‚Äù  For my wardrobe last year I wanted to add some typical cottage+cowboy style pieces, since I live on a farm now and it felt kind of fun. Using her method I broke down what I liked about the cottage/farm style into this: - patterns and colours: plaid, paisley, traditional embroidery, light colours, plant/animals print, fringe - materials: cotton, leather, suede, denim - items: flowy dresses + tops, cowboy boots, sandals   Using all of that I added the following items over the last year ish: - white embroidered denim jacket - black denim jacket with plaid lining - cowboy boots - flowy embroidered blouse - flowy paisley dress - embroidered jeans - fringe skirt  I usually have a tougher/punker look, so i can wear eg my plaid sundress with sandals + embroidered jacket for a countrier look, or I can wear it with my combat boots. I can wear my embroidered jeans with my embroidered blouse for a cottage look, or I can wear it with a colourblock sweater and ankle boots for a day in the city. It added a bit of feminine with the flowiness but also more of the masculine that I usually gravitate towards. Still really versatile!

text:If money were no object? Bespoke or haute couture?	labels:In this hypothetical I'd go with haute couture. In your friend's situation I'd keep looking until I found a designer I liked. Bespoke would be my last option for a couple of reasons. Your friend wants contemporary fashion, but most bespoke tailors make traditional clothes for a typically older crowd (you're in NYC though so there are some bespoke tailors catering to a younger crowd; make sure you look for them specifically). The bespoke tailors catering to a younger crowd don't have designs as good as high end ready to wear IMO. Tailoring and designing are different skills, and there's a reason Louis Vuittion, YSL, Dior, Gucci, etc pay their head designers millions per year. Of course some $4000 coats are worth more than others, so it would be good to know a bit about general quality.  Personally, I prioritize design over fit. I can deal with a less than perfect fit if I love the design of a piece. But I won't wear a piece if I don't love the design, even if it fits well.   The middle ground option is made to measure, or MTM. MTM for outerwear isn't as common for suiting, but it's out there.
text:Well, but bespoke tailors can do anything. They all have a house style, and maybe the Haute Couture brands do something a given house won't replicate, but unless theres' something really unique happening, you'll probably be able to find *some* house that can make you at least as happy. Probably.  The real issue with Bespoke is just the amount of time it takes.	labels:In theory, but I suspect that the number of bespoke tailors who are 1) willing to do fashion-forward contemporary designs, 2) able to understand the 'source code' and styling of those designs well enough to capture the details of what makes a particular piece special, and 3) able to procure the exact materials needed to do so is likely vanishingly small in practice.  I've seen examples on fashion fora of people asking bespoke tailors -- even talented ones -- to replicate designer stuff, and the results are usually a poor approximation.	episode_done:True

Additionally, is there any point in having chelsea boots in a minimalist collection? For example, if I already have oxford shoes for formal wear, and white leather shoes for anything else, do these cover everything?
text:I'd consider using one slot for a truly weatherproof shoe, or looking into a more weather-ready style than a sleek designer Chelsea.  Walking about in snow can destroy shoes pretty quickly, especially if you're dealing with salt and slush.

text:Hiking Aesthetic - Functionality vs. Fashion	labels:Honestly, most people that get serious about hiking learn pretty quickly that fashion is low on the priority list. You can colour coordinate your gear but it's not really going to be fashion.
text:Exactly this truthfully. You start to look at everything your wearing for its physical properties. Something that will keep me 1 degree warmer while not increasing my weight is way more important than any fashion considerations. I'm not even nearly as serious as most people.   Otherwise on casual day hikes I just wear a mix of "normal" clothes and what is most important to me such as shoes and socks.   Not to say you can't go the "other" way with your clothing. I wear my merino wool base layers under regular clothing all the time same with my hiking socks. I also have multiple copies of my hiking pants that I wear both hiking and as casual wear.  I think the only thing that really matters is don't wear cotton/linen/plant fibers hiking, unless your bringing a change of clothes.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What is something you've heard as fashion advice that isn't worth following?	labels:I don't think any fashion rule should be followed. You should take heed of them, but there just general guidelines and tips not the holy word of the lord. If you are self conscious of your wide hips, then it's a good thing to be aware that a lot of horizontal striped will exaggerate this. Doesn't mean you can't or shouldn't, just that you should be cognizant to check before buying any horizontal stripes. Pretty much every fashion rule *can* be broken, but it takes you understanding why the rule is the rule before you can understand how & when you can get away with breaking it   I think *most* attempts to inject color theory into style advice is overly reductionist and doesn't quite work for most people (*especially* for non-white people)  I also think that most shoe advice and recommendations should be ignored. If you do not like heels or are not good at walking in heels, than no, 2 inch wedged are *not* a "laid back summer look for a garden party". You're gonna look fucking ridiculous clomping around. On the other hand, if you *love* platforms and know how to rock them, then there's very few circumstances where you can't figure out a way to make platforms work. Plus, people don't pay nearly as much attention to shoes as you'd think anyway. For most people, it's not in our eyeliner of what we look at when we look at a person. So just wear what you like regardless of the kind of shoes deemed "appropriate". I think that with "Personal style", shoes are substantially more personal than style compared to other items.	episode_done:True
text:General Discussion - January 10, 2021	labels:Out of curiosity what setups are you guys using to take and edit your fit pics? Phone in a mug? Professional camera?

I have a 23mm lens on a Fuji X-Pro1 (APS-C, so I believe 35mm equivalent) that I usually mount on a tripod with a 10sec timer & 6-frame burst-shot. It's time consuming to set up and get a good picture because the preview is tiny and there's no e.g. WiFi sharing so my alternative setup is a phone mount for the same tripod. Recently discovered I can get a live preview from my phone on my laptop so I've been using that to browse the pictures and check I've framed everything correctly etc.  I use the lightroom mobile app to crop and edit the photos. Basically every photo is cropped because I have to stand quite far back from the camera to get everything in without distortion.

text:How do you guys work towards avoiding fast fashion?	labels:Personally, I really like thrift shopping. I can't afford high quality brands, and hate fast fashion. By thrifting, I am often able to find old, quality clothing. I got a pair of 90's calvin klein jeans, and some old levi's, and I've even gotten some very quality pants from the 60's-70's that still have tags.   I got a pair of Docs back when they were still made in England, very sturdy and will last me a good while.   A recent find was a very nice custom made elk hide jacket, and it was only $6.   It can definitely take a little bit of time, but it's very worth it. All of the things I have mentioned seem, from text, like they would be worn, ugly, old.

text:Learning to dress better	labels:First, I'd like to echo other commenters sentiments and say that investing in a good hair cut is absolutely worth it. Finding a good barber, hairstyle that you feel compliments your hair type and face shape, and that you feel good about are all worth it. I've never regretted putting in the time to find a good barber. Also, don't be afraid to try things, it is just hair after all. I'd also like to say just be patient with yourself and give yourself time. I started figuring out I cared how I dressed when I was in university, but my sense of style is very different now from what it was then (a lot less band shirts). So don't be afraid to try things and explore different styles to figure out what you like. Thirdly, basics (as other people have mentioned) are worth investing in. You cannot go wrong with a clean t-shirt and a pair of well fitting jeans. Fourth, shoes are worth investing in. I wish I would have learned that earlier. You can get most basic wardrobe needs for relatively cheap through places like uniqlo and they'll hold up decently well. But a good pair of shoes will last you a long time. I bought my first pair of really nice, high quality boots last year and it's a totally different experience. It's awesome that you are realizing you want to dress better, just be patient.

text:General Discussion - December 13, 2020	labels:The long comment thread below got me thinking.   I feel like we live in a time where dozens of fashion subcultures are able to exist at once. I've never seen so many designers and brands across several "genres" all thriving so well.  Saying something isn't "in fashion" just seems wild to me right now. Because honestly I think what's "fashionable" is exploring your own personal style and aesthetic. Being yourself is what's currently cool, and I think that's dope.
text:Sometimes I wonder how of this is bias towards the present.   There definitely have been large scale trends lately: notably luxury streetwear, which is starting to ebb (Virgil Abloh, Kim Jones, and Jerry Lorenzo have all been trying to pivot to tailoring lately).  Sure, not everybody has been on the streetwear train, but not everybody in the past marched in trendy lockstep either. We think of the eighties as pretty homogenous, but football shoulder *Wall Street* tailoring, prep, punk, and new wave were all happening at the same time, Issey Miyake was in the middle of his career and Comme and Yohji were getting their starts. If you were living in the middle of that and you cared about fashion, you probably wouldn't think there was just one trendy thing at a time either.   Maybe in 2060 we'll all be looking back on the 10s as The Streetwear Era and think that trends are just at that moment starting to die.	labels:As someone in their 40s, this era feels a lot more wide open than the 80s, 90s, 00s, or 10s (to about 2017 or so when the opening started).

text:Brands that no longer live up to their name or quality	labels:kind of all of them? It seems like you have to pay pretty steep prices now to get the quality of clothes that mid-price mall brands had in the 1990s and early 2000s. It seems that most stores have switched to a model of selling poor quality pieces at huge markups with the expectation that they will sell most of the stock at clearance prices. The GAP used to have quality staples, and J Crew was "fancy." Now GAP is really the same quality as Old Navy, and don't know what J Crew is anymore. The quality has certainly dropped, but I also don't get what is up with the designs since you can't even get a reasonable women's suit there these days. Madewell is not made well. Anthropologie used to sell unique pieces with really good construction, now it's roughly the same as other fast fashion, though I do appreciate that they added petite and plus sizing and carry some high end brands too. Levi's main line is terrible now, and to get the heritage quality, you need to get the Made and Crafted line, which is really expensive!  I mostly shop secondhand because I can't afford the stuff I like. When buying new, I try to wait for sales and avoid buying anything "final sale" or with complicated returns unless I know it will work. Clothes that I used to get at Anthropologie, I now get from Sezane, Ulla Johnson, Doen, and Samantha Pleet. I started buying vintage jeans over Madewell/Levi's or expensive craft brands‚Äîmy 1980s Chic and Gitano jeans were probably sold at K-Mart/Target but are better quality than anything I have gotten from Madewell. I don't wear jeans/denim enough to justify craft denim prices. Patagonia is still very high quality technical wear; I just scope out the Tyler sport outlet and secondhand for deals. Shoes are hard because I don't like to get them secondhand. I switched from Adidas to Veja and Diemme for sneakers (you can find Diemme shoes for huge markdowns on Yoox during the winter and summer sales‚ÄîI don't think they are worth retail price).
text:How are the Veja trainies? I keep eyeing those up	labels:I have the V-lock sneakers. I bought my first pair \~2 years ago and replaced them with a newer pair this summer. The only ones were in wearable condition, they just were very worn and dirty looking because the shoes are white and stuff gets into the velcro. I wear those as a backup now. Vejas are not the most comfortable sneakers ever‚Äîthey take a while to break in and aren't made for running/sports. But once you replace the insole and break them in, the leather softens up and they really do last. The seams of the sneakers got dirty, but the white leather itself did not scuff or stain despite heavy use. The soles are very thick and only seem to have minor wear after a year of very frequent wear‚Äîusually I will destroy sneaker soles within a few months. Veja leather sneakers are great for walking around cities and just throwing on as casual shoes. They also seem pretty weather resistant and are comfortable in most weather. I definitely recommend them as long as you are prepared for them to be uncomfortable at first! And definitely replace the insole.

text:It could work, but the execution is tricky. I don't think you could structure these threads too strictly.

text:General Discussion - December 01, 2020	labels:Some of the best ring sizing advice I've seen from Alicia Hannah Naomi:  > You are strongly encouraged to check your ring size carefully before placing your order.Ring sizing is not an exact science. Tools and techniques used to read and take sizes can vary from jeweller to jeweller, but being sized professionally by an experienced assistant at a reputable jewellery store is always the most accurate way to determine your ring size. Using string or paper to work out your circumference size is often unreliable.  >Make sure to factor in which hand you want to wear the ring on, and the temperature the day you are fitted as this can affect your size. Check that space between the base of the finger and the knuckle is wide enough to accommodate how tall the ring measures. Personal comfort is also a factor, but ideally, a ring should need a hard wiggle to get over the knuckle - too easy and you may risk it falling off, too much resistance and you may not get it back over the knuckle again.   >The heavier and wider a ring is, the larger the size you will typically need to wear. You may need to add one or two full UK sizes to your usual ring size when choosing a heavy and wide ring. An experienced jewellery store assistant should be able to advise you whilst you are being measured.

text:How do you know if a piece of clothing is worth its price?	labels:A fair amount of what makes a garment last/wear well is how you take care of it.   Extremely cheap fast fashion like YesStyle is going to wash/wear poorly, so you need to be very gentle with washing those kinds of garments. Hand washing, coldwater washing on low speeds, and air-drying will make those kinds of garments last longer. I have 10-year-old Forever 21 dresses because of how I wash them.  For American-made brands, I like LA Apparel and Bug Bud Press. However, keep in mind that these brands are expensive for a reason, and they have fewer styles and sizes for a reason. To try and understand clothing price and quality, try and think about how can this YesStyle dress possibly cost $11? How long does it take to make a dress, what would I like to be paid for making a dress, how much does fabric cost per yard, how can this brand afford to make this many styles, colors, and sizes? You'll realize that the only way for a garment to cost that little is because corners are being cut SOMEWHERE.	episode_done:True

She nodded in approvement and then told me no one would take me seriously as long as I wore cheap sweaters. I then bought a wildly pretty ivory cable knit sweater and wore it to work and feeling quite exactly like 1000000 bucks AND i had fancy nylons too. She told me no one would take me seriously with my unkempt shoes and that's when I learned the power of a shoe shining kit.  The next day I wore crappy slacks...and, well you know how the story goes.  To this very day I wear natty clothes and shoes so shiney they can blind fleet of Greek warriors.  The only real irony is no one gave a tootie about nylons and yet I still wear them despite all evidence to the contrary....and she threw al hers away after our company got bought out by another and they were no longer required.

I paired it with a rather full cut white dress shirt and black tie.   It won't see much use in the future except for other funerals, and frankly, I don't see much issue with that. It's polyester-y and the shoulders are off, but there won't be much in the way of judgement about the minutia of it. Keep that in mind. As long as it's reasonably conservative, it will do.  I don't know exactly about what outerwear you could get. But I suppose thrifting a dark, conservative coat would be best. Black, Grey, Navy.	episode_done:True

text:Does anyone have tips on how to find good stuff from Poshmark and other online thrift shopping platforms?	labels:Poshmark filters suck, but the fact that you can ask the seller for more details and they can offer you discounts means that you can find great things!  I find that if I like something, about 30% of the time the seller will offer me a discount right away, so start going crazy on the likes if you are ready to purchase something.  I always sort by new so you get first pick of the best stuff.    I search for specific fabrics, but this doesn't work perfectly on Poshmark.  I love linen, so I often just type "linen" into the search bar and see what I find.  The problem is that Poshmark doesn't have a fabric filter, so "linen-looking" items will end up in there, and sellers that don't list fabric won't show up there.  But I've found awesome pieces this way!  "My size" straight up doesn't work for me.  It's annoying, but I always manually pick my size once I get to a category.	episode_done:True

I add everything to a list, and wait until Amazon's algorithms decide they need to sell it for $6. They also offer Tall sizes on quite a lot of items, which is great for having sleeves that fit.  Uniqlo for jeans, Amazon's Peak Velocity brand for Tshirts, and Goodthreads for everything else is what I would do if I had to start from Scratch.  If there's a certain type of item your looking for, feel free to ask for recommendations and I can send you a link to what I'd look at.
text:Thanks for sharing!   Items I'm looking for:  \- White sneakers - preferably leather   \- Jeans - Slim/skinny light blue, navy, black   \- Jackets - from bomber jackets to other non-bomber kinds  \- Sweaters or sweatshirts I can layer under my jacket  \- Long sleeve shirts/henleys  \- boots   If you've come across any of these on amazon that you think may be decent purchase I'd love to check it out	labels:Amazon has pretty decent t-shirts and sweatshirts (not knit sweaters!) that you can get for a good price. You can also buy some decent quality sneakers from Amazon too, just make sure it's from a reputable seller and from a recognized shoe brand (Adidas/New Balance/etc.).  &#x200B;  However, for stuff like jeans, jackets, boots, and knitwear, I'd look elsewhere. I've bought jeans from Amazon in the past that came with low-quality buttons and ripped after 2 months of wear, so I don't think the quality is quite there. My recommendation would be to search on places like Uniqlo/Carhartt/Champion or even thrift stores to get better quality jeans/jackets/knitwear that can last you a lot longer than whatever you'd find on Amazon for a comparable price.
text:Yeah - I wouldn't skimp on denim and footwear. A nice pair of boots that will last years and grow patina, same with denim fades. You can skimp a bit on the rest -    for example today I'm wearing: $300 Samurai Jeans, $x00 boots, $x00 vintage watch - but paired with an $8 Hanes cotton/poly sweatshirt from amazon and $5 generic khaki hat from walmart.	labels:As much as I love denim, $300 for a pair vs a brand like Uniqlo that you can get for $49 is absurd to me.
text:Yes very understandable. There is great value in every tier. This is one example of jumping straight to the high end once I found the details that I liked after experimenting with gap/uniqlo/entry-level  denim.	labels:Fair enough. What frequency do you replace jeans at that tier?
text:I have had these Samurai for about 5-6 years now. I actually picked up a SDA, 3sixteen, and a few PBJ on a trip to Los Angeles last year in January. Different styles and colors for different outfit ideas and trips I had planned ... but then COVID hit.	labels:That‚Äôs a relatively good period of time for denim.
text:Haha yeah - I will admit that there were a few periods where I was unable to wear them frequently. I have actually lost weight after purchasing them 5 years ago, and the relaxed fit probably reduced any chance for common crotch blowouts. Other than that, I just wear them like jeans. Wash them without much care, in the machine. The recent pairs from last year were to fill up some wardrobe holes.. a black pair, a super neppy pair, an interesting dye pattern, and one that was appropriate for sport coats & blazers.	labels:	episode_done:True

I don‚Äôt think that any of these groups should be completely separate however I do find them all being lumped into the same spaces very frustrating as someone who does love fashion as a form of art and creativity.  I like harsh and blunt constructive criticism in pretty much all areas of life and I most certainly want it for my outfits as well. I want to hear what other fashion lovers and artists think of my colour choices, proportions, textures, fit, etc. and be able to refine those things and really flex my creative muscles when creating an outfit. Instead, many fashion spaces are dominated by ‚Äòyou do you hun!‚Äô and ‚Äòso long as you like it, that‚Äôs all that matters!‚Äô which is great for someone *who has to wear clothes* and doesn‚Äôt actually care about fashion but joins fashion spaces because they feel some obligation as a woman to care about it but... those spaces just become unhelpful and bland for those who really love fashion and want to get better at it.  I‚Äôve been an off and on follower of FFA for a few years and I feel like it‚Äôs definitely dominated by the ‚Äúpeople who wear clothes‚Äù group and unfortunately it limits the amount of critique that is acceptable to give.

Had I known how much trouble it would be to break into watches, I might have said never mind and wisely walked away. I didn‚Äôt, though.   Some pointers for those interested:  1.	The cost of the watch is only the upfront cost. Like a car, a mechanical watch needs regular maintenance. Generally speaking, this will be anywhere from $300 to $1,000+...every 5-7 years.  2.	Because of point #1, entry level (~ $500) mechanical watches are not pieces you will pass down to your kids. In fact, it is usually cheaper to trash them entirely and buy new than to bother having them serviced.  3.	People will tell you there are deals to be had in the vintage market. That‚Äôs true, but it can also be difficult to find parts or people willing to work on them. 4.	There is relatively little offered between entry level and about $3,000.  5.	There is nothing wrong with wearing a quartz or digital watch.   All that being said, I still love my small collection. Just wish I had known those things from the start.

text:/u/pieface777 is right, and there's also eBay.  That said, trad is the dress style of the American old-money elite. The ethos is to buy well and then wear it into the ground, so there's a thriftiness there, but it's not one based on seasonal fast fashion. It's more based on buying a good pair of shoes and then taking care of them, having them resoled when necessary. It's buying a great Shetland sweater but then having it darned, or patched with leather, as it wears out (or just wearing it with holes).  Back during the #menswear days of 10 years ago there was a kind of fetishization of that sort of thing. I think people by and large are aware now that it still takes money to have this sort of relationship to your clothes. I also think there are a lot of 3/2 sack blue blazers and repp ties that are not getting quite as much wear as people might have expected when they bombed out big bucks for them, because the style isn't as in fashion anymore. Thus, more opportunities for the rest of us on eBay.	labels:	episode_done:True

I often even double up socks if I‚Äôm going to be walking around a lot and my current boots are a full size larger than my normal shoe size.   Also, other people have mentioned it, but a thermal base layer is a must, especially for your lower body. I don‚Äôt use my thermal tops that much, the upper body gets your sweaters and your coat, but if the only thing standing between the elements and your legs is jeans you‚Äôre gonna be COLD.	episode_done:True
text:Does anyone else wear one brand only?	labels:I felt that way about lululemon when I took the plunge last January and bought my first pair of leggings. About 50 lululemon pieces later (and lots of money spent) I don't really feel the urge to add new items to my lululemon collection.  Lululemon is best for lounging or going to the gym so lately I've been more focused on buying cool clothes I can wear to work. I have been buying a lot of aritzia, zara, and h&m to fill the office clothes void though.	episode_done:True

I'm fitting into older jeans now but it turns out five-years-ago me really dug mid-rise and current me really, really doesn't. Now that I've learned how having my waistband at my actual waistline means I don't have to pull my jeans back up 500x a day, I can't go back. Sorry, mid-rise. To the thrift store with you.	episode_done:True
text:How many clothes do you have? (Really?)	labels:I think the size of your wardrobe is going to depend on your climate, job, hobbies, and general lifestyle. I have a lot more clothing than that. I also live in a place with four seasons. I have outdoorsy hobbies that require some tougher clothes. I can‚Äòt wear my casual clothing to work (and I‚Äôm also holding onto some more professional clothing from a past job in case I return to that field). I don‚Äôt have a lot of disposable income either, so I always keep things like dress pants even though I never wear them in my everyday, because I can‚Äôt afford to go shopping when interviews and funerals come up.  For instance, I probably have at least 15 dresses alone, once you count all the strappy sundresses, nice work dresses, wool sweater dresses, the cocktail dresses, and the evening gown that‚Äôs in the back of my closet - and everything in between.  I swap out my clothing with the seasons and have one closet that I share with my husband, so I try to be judicious about what I keep, while giving myself grace that I don‚Äôt need to get rid of something just because I don‚Äôt wear it regularly.
text:Living in a place that has a cold winter and a hot summer makes a capsule wardrobe pretty much impossible. I don't have that many clothes per season, but as there's four of them, stuff adds up quick. Not to mention things you need to keep around even if you don't wear them in years. I'm not going to throw out my snow boots and parka just because we've had two mild winters.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Moncler acquires Stone Island	labels:Unexpected, but interesting. I'd rather Moncler became more like SI than SI became like Moncler, but genius and the RO collab shows that they're willing to be adventurous.
text:My take on this is that it‚Äôs easier for Moncler, a premium/high fashion brand to venture into street wear realm with collaborations, than to elevate SI, a streetwear/sort of techwear brand into high fashion - where Moncler operates. I also love how Moncler is pretty selective with who they collaborate with, and on that note, I‚Äôm weary of the route Arcteryx (one of my favorite brand for outdoor wear) is going with their recent collaboration with Palace. My fear is they diverge away from their outdoor focus and become another The North Face. But there is still hope - there‚Äôs apparently a Jil Sander x Arcteryx in the works.	labels:	episode_done:True

A wardrobe that contains (also, or mostly, or some, depending on your preference) timeless pieces, is something that builds over time.

text:what pieces/brands did you buy when moving from a warmer climate to a cooler climate? what did you end up regretting/not using?	labels:Many years ago I moved from Hawaii to college in the Northeast. I would recommend 1) Buying it all there, because they'll have what's good for their climate and 2) starting out with cheaper options (thrifted, Old Navy, Target range) even if it's not quite your style. Don't spend much time, effort, and money until you see how you really feel after at least a year of seasons. Maybe you want warmer stuff than you thought you would, or realize you should invest in nicer socks, or discover you don't actually like turtlenecks, or shift to a different style when you're surrounded by a new area's vibe. Let yourself experience it for a bit without pressuring yourself to do it all right.
text:This.   Our gear is made for the cold.  We have lots of items at resale shops because coats are fashion.         My personal favorite is silk long underwear.  It is lightweight and easy to wear under clothes.    Expect to wear a hoody indoors.  Heck, I like to port around my scarf indoors too.     Respect the cold and dont do dumb stuff.  When you go somewhere in a car dress like you will have an accident and need to walk a mile.  Do not jump into your car with shorts and boots just because you look cute.	labels:You don‚Äôt always need to dress like you are going to walk a mile. You can still be stylish in the winter. Just be prepared and make sure you have warm gear with you in the car in case. I wear heels to work, so I make sure I have a pair of boots in the car. For comfort and safety. Or I wear the boots and bring the heels and change at work. You aren‚Äôt banned from wearing anything. I have an ankle length coat so I comfortably wear dresses/skirts with tights most days. I also do have a blanket, hat and extra gloves in my car just in case, but I don‚Äôt let the cold stop me from wearing anything. You just have to make the proper modifications. I grew up in one of the snowiest, coldest places my whole life  but I love fashion and just make sure I am prepared.

text:Does anyone have tips on how to find good stuff from Poshmark and other online thrift shopping platforms?	labels:I have a really hard time shopping on poshmark. I find I have to be super specific and it's not great for browsing. For instance "j crew tan cashmere cardigan" gets a manageable result but "flowy top" does not. I also uncheck boutique as that's all cheap stuff from china and search by brand when I have one in mind.   Ebay is has more filters which helps to narrow items down. I usually filter by material and country (only shop within the us since that's where I am, this gets rid of all the new stuff from china).  Also, I would definitely recommend thredup because you can return things. I recently placed my first order from them and ended up returning about half of it. They charge $2 per return and for free shipping you have to take store credit, which I think is fair and way better than just being stuck with something that doesn't fit. You can set up saved searches to make it easy to check for new items and also filter by brand/material/size/condition and sort by newest first.   Depop is also worth checking out, I find it to be a bit more curated and trendy than poshmark but often overpriced. There are less items so searching is more manageable, and search results are based on an algorithm (poshmark is just newest first). Also shipping is cheaper for small/light things.  Another one people are into is the real real, I haven't ordered from them myself but have seen it recommended. I think it's pretty much a higher end thredup.	episode_done:True

text:Favourite places to get your fall wool fix?	labels:Don‚Äôt forget to check out thrift stores. This is where I stock up on cashmere sweaters for a few dollars a piece, wool skirts, kilts, sweaters, vests, and cardigans, and amazing wool blazers and coats. I‚Äôve found mint condition mohair and camel hair 3/4 coats for as low as $10, black cashmere sweaters for $2-3 and up, and cable knit pullovers for as low as $4. It‚Äôs amazing what people get rid of, not realizing how expensive it all is new. I also loooove wool in the fall and winter, and so this has been a super affordable way to build a dream cold-weather wardrobe.   The only thing wool I buy new are socks for the most part, everything else I‚Äôve found at estate sales, garage sales, and thrift shops. When/if you go, definitely go through the boys and men‚Äôs departments, too. A bit of tailoring can make anything look custom like some of the pieces on Walker Slater maybe.

text:This. Get a cashmere cardigan and it will keep you warm. The buttons in the front give you some options for how warm you want to be, and it is easily taken off compared to a sweater in case you‚Äôre inside somewhere where the heater is on too high. Keep in mind that cashmere ranges in quality these days. Price is not always an indicator. Check how soft it feels and check the blend % (try to avoid polyester blends). I recommend trying to snag a high quality one during Black Friday sales or at an outlet.   You could also get a collared button up fleece shirt. You can wear it on top of a long sleeve shirt (unbuttoned/buttoned), it‚Äôs also easy to take off indoors, not to thick or much volume so it‚Äôs easy to throw into your briefcase/backpack, and if it get‚Äôs colder you can wear a cardigan on top of it all.   If it gets cold enough to where there‚Äôs ice on the roads and you feel like you‚Äôre freezing to death whenever you step outside, Uniqlo has some ‚Äúheat tech‚Äù thermal pants that you can wear under normal pants, and nobody need notice. It makes all the difference in freezing temperatures.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:What clothing items have you reverted back to since WFH/quarantine?	labels:I've really been embracing dressing more youthful. I'm in my early/mid 20s, and now that I've worked a couple years at the same place, I'm wearing more what I want than boring professional. I also started caring about what I wear and planning my outfits. Velvet shoes, corduroy overalls, rainbow prints, sequins, bold colors. Who cares? I've been called out for dressing "fancy" before, but I've stopped giving a shit in correlation with my confidence in my abilities. I'm a teacher...if anything, I'm showing the students it's okay to be yourself and take risks.

Personally, I think Tommy, Calvin Klein, Hugo Boss, and some lines from Armani are all low-end brands that bank on their names and established supply chains and distribution networks to get attention for cheaply made, uninspired clothing. Some Armani clothing is better, but it's all drastically overpriced. Lauren Ralph Lauren and some Polo Ralph Lauren are the same; some Polo Ralph Lauren is pretty good, but you won't find it in a Macy's or equivalent. The really good Ralph Lauren clothing is mostly only sold in Ralph Lauren stores.  Lacose is fine. Nothing too special, but not trash.  Ermenegildo Zegna is quite good. Better than Z Zegna, not as good as zegna couture, pretty nice in general.

As for the "wanting to look professional but wanting to look / feel like myself", I think a LOT of people struggle with this. I feel like for the emo look, wearing all black can still be seen as very professional, I think the issue more would be the cuts of the clothes. It also depends on your profession / workplace - obviously some places are much more lenient and you can get away with a lot more skin. Maybe wearing jewelry that is more alternative can also be a good way to look professional but feel like yourself.	episode_done:True

text:What is something you've heard as fashion advice that isn't worth following?	labels:Probably the advice that anything I wear as a fat person has to be slimming or flattering. Yes I wear a lot of black, but just because it's easy not because it makes me look thinner. My size isn't a big secret or anything.   Also this is taking a really broad view but the fashion culture of planned obsolescence, declaring certain things "out" and other things "in," is super classist and unsustainable, so even though I enjoy reading about new trends I don't really care to follow them.

text:Is the high fashion industry a little tone-deaf for F/W 2020?	labels:No, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs tone deaf that fashion houses or designers are releasing collections that, like oconorris mentioned, were designed a year+ in advance.   As cities and *other* countries begin to re open people will begin to adapt to the new norm and resume their day to day activities so that will present more opportunities for them to go out and wear new clothes. I‚Äôm in America so don‚Äôt expect to relate any time soon lol  Having said that, there‚Äôs something for everyone. There‚Äôs quite a few brands that offer natural fibers, minimalistic looks, but no guarantee that greenwashing isn‚Äôt involved or that they aren‚Äôt treating their employees like shit.   The world doesn‚Äôt revolve around America so I‚Äôm not sure that more affordable brands will drop whatever collections they had designed for 6+ months just to adapt to whatever image people have in mind during this pandemic.
text:I do wonder about how fashion will acknowledge the recoveries of different countries.  Like Wuhan's throwing pool parties now, so--you know, it's a different vibe.  The fact that China also consumes a lot of luxury goods also complicates things; and I wonder if the Chinese consumer would be interested in some of the more drab utilitarian offerings I've seen trickling in.  On the whole, Chinese consumers don't exactly get excited about dropping big dollars on depression chic (and does anyone really?).	labels:This entire sub does lol

text:When/why did you get your first really fancy purse/bag?	labels:I got my first fancy bag after calling off my wedding lol I figured it cost around the same amount as the dress I wouldn‚Äôt ever wear so why not? The woman at the LV store thought I was on drugs ... ‚Äúare you celebrating something?‚Äù And I‚Äôm like as a matter of fact, yes, yes I am. I just lost a ton of money on a wedding but I dodged a bullet and left that POS. All she said was ‚Äúwell you can always make more money‚Äù anyway, I‚Äôm getting a Chanel bag for my next milestone birthday. Not sure which one but it‚Äôs gonna happen soon.
text:Kind working off of this premise, my mother always emphasized that a expensive designer purchase should be attached to a goal or important milestone. Ever since high-school I wanted a designer bag, and as soon as it become possible for me to buy one with my own money I had a goal in mind. I had been worked as a contracted worker for 2 years and was aiming to get a stable full time job. When it finally happened I gave myself the go ahead to purchase a bag and waited till I found one that I liked and fit my lifestyle (Small Chanel Gabrielle).	labels:	episode_done:True

text:More Men Reach for Sewing Machines	labels:Mom was a nurse and so I grew up hanging around a nursing home. In that time I learned to sew, knit, and crochet and it's interesting how much of a stigma there was around it, I just loved to create things. This was in the 90s. One woman would even tell me not to be ashamed, that there was a football player who knit (name escapes me).  I've had friends recently finally notice a lot of my mending and sewing machine, and ask if it was a pandemic thing. Like, no it's just not something you really talk about for some reason.	episode_done:True
text:What are you looking forward to buying for "pandemic life" this summer?	labels:Every spring I say I'm going to get some interesting spring/summer clothes, and then I just buy more polos.  I had a baby last year and form-fitting shirts just don't look good on me anymore. But I couldn't find anything else that worked so I spent the warm months wearing t-shirts. (Which turned out to be fine since anything I wore ended up covered in spit up anyway)  So I'm really hoping that by summer at least, pandemic numbers are low enough that I can actually go out and try new clothes on and find stuff that works for me. Otherwise... I guess it's t-shirts and jeans again. :/	episode_done:True

text:Does anyone else have this style issue?	labels:Figure out what inspires you about the style and then "translate" that to your own shape (and vibe and lifestyle etc). The retro men's khakis probably look good on the men in the photos because they're tailored to flatter that specific shape - they communicate ease and perfection and the possibility of summer fun. Try a capri pant in a bright or summery color that fits your shape to communicate those vibes on yourself.	episode_done:True

text:Inspo Album: Pulling the Past Forward, Asian-style	labels:Why call it a BIPOC album if it is just Asian people. Call it Asian diaspora.
text:There are black and indigenous people in Asia. There are multiracial people, there are immigrants, and, while I can‚Äôt speak to every country in Asia, there are black Filipinos whose families have been in the Philippines for just as many centuries as mine.  If we were talking about a group of exclusively Han Chinese people or something, I‚Äôd agree with you that BIPOC might not be the right term. But Asians aren‚Äôt a monolith and neither are the people who live in Asia.  The OP was clear that the clothes in this album are inspired by Asian culture and the models do skew heavily towards the typical E/SE Asian, but OP said the brands are mostly BIPOC-owned and I think that‚Äôs a fair statement to make when we don‚Äôt know the background of each brand‚Äôs owner. Particularly when one of the brands included in the album is owned by a woman of Nigerian descent living in Singapore.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:How do you dress in a casual work environment if you really enjoy fashion/dressing up?	labels:I used to work in an environment that was super casual. Because we had no dealings with the public, we could wear hoodies and sweatpants to work if we wanted to. I just wore whatever I wanted to. Some days that was jeans and a comfy shirt, other days it was heeled booties with a dressy blouse and vest. The only thing I kept in mind was what job I'd be doing that day. I floated around different departments, so I'd dress nicer on days I'd be mostly sitting, and I dressed more casual on days I'd be doing hard work in the shipping area. Other than that, I dressed however I wanted. I didn't mind standing out because I was dressed better than everyone else. I was also the youngest person there (I was 19, looking more like 14) so I figured people were already judging me for that, so might as well add judging me for dressing way better than they did in there. I did a good job and my work spoke for itself, so I didn't notice any real negative effects from my fashion choices. A few grumpy people probably thought I was some bougie millennial, but they were so miserable I'm sure they hate everything anyway.  &#x200B;  Edit: I also want to add that I agree with everyone else that crop tops are never appropriate for the office, no matter how casual the environment is.	episode_done:True

text:Synthetics in Our Wardrobe	labels:This subreddit has a serious hate boner for synthetics and I will never understand why. It seriously depends on the fabric and the purpose of the garment. Not all rayon or viscose or polyester or nylon is the same. It's like you said, the Uniqlo heattech or their amazing wrinkle-free perfectly drapey rayon blouses are so good. Is all rayon wrinkle free or behave like that? lol no... Which is why you need to look at reviews or touch the material yourself. When you touch it, you can just tell it's good...  Not all "natural" materials are elegant or good either. Sometimes stuff like linen is so trash-bag wrinkly. Sometimes cotton/linen/silk really holds in the sweat and makes you stink, or forms sweat stains on your pits, whereas there's loads of moisture wicking poly athletic clothing or super expensive technical gear for hiking or professional sports which is designed for a specific purpose from synthetic material that keeps you ultra dry, ultra cool, whatever it may be. Poly is also good UPF protection from the sun. Some of my most expensive hiking gear is made from polyester. There is some clothing I own, which I can toss in the washing machine, and after the spin cycle, it's completely dry, without the dry rack.   Acrylics can be super itchy and pilly, or be super tightly woven, soft, and incredibly durable. It really depends. You can't just look at the label and put it away because "omg ew polyester 100%" you need to touch it, stretch it, scrape your nail against it to see how the fabric performs.   tl;dr There's loads of great high quality fabrics in all materials whether it's natural fiber or man-made and I don't really have any negative opinion of anything until I see it in person, and touch it and wear it and I don't think it should matter at all, so long as you personally like it

text:FAQ: When shopping on a budget, what items have the highest point at which they reach diminishing returns?	labels:In my experience, lower quality at lower price points is most noticeable for outerwear, footwear, or knits (I guess because they all serve a functional purpose) and spending more tends to lead to a more noticeable improvement in quality up to a certain point. That's painting with a broad brush though... leather dress shoes and boots scale much better than sneakers or sandals, where mid-range options are going to be good enough for most people.  T-shirts, dress shirts, denim, and accessories in low-to-mid-range are generally good enough from a quality perspective IMO and I've only really paid more in those categories for a design I like rather than because I think I'm getting something higher quality. There's nothing wrong IMO with buying something because you like the way it looks even if a similar quality alternative exists at a lower price, but that's harder to do if you're shopping on a budget.  I'll also add that for all of the above, your dollar goes a lot farther if you're willing to shop used. Sites like Ebay, Grailed, reddit/styleforum B/S/T threads, etc. have made it a lot easier to buy preowned clothes without having to set foot into a thrift store.  TL;DR When shopping on a budget I'd focus first on having a high quality pair of shoes and jacket. Consider buying used clothes to stretch your budget further.
text:> ower quality at lower price points is most noticeable for outerwear, footwear, or knits (I guess because they all serve a functional purpose)  Also because of the cost of raw materials like wool or leather. A $100 wool coat will always be thin and flimsy because wool isn't cheap and you need a lot of it for a coat. The only way to make that $100 coat is to use less wool, either by replacing some of it with polyester or by using less of it.  (Which, in this specific example, leads to people buying a cheap woollen coat and a cheap down jacket and wearing them both at the same time. Which does make sense for a lot of people, but I can't help finding it a bit funny.)	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Dressing larger bodies - without looking sloppy	labels:I work retail and I see a lot of customers who are plus-size/large wearing oversize pieces and they make it work.

Having this attitude has helped me so much in not agonizing over what to wear to work every day. I know I'm not proportionate and I'm not going to try and disguise it with shapewear.

Once in a while I will pick up a cheap item that‚Äôs not ethically sourced, but I have found that I can now cover most of my clothing needs without cluttering my wardrobe with a bunch of fast fashion. The two brands I mention are still reasonably priced, with most items between $100 and $200.	episode_done:True
text:Learning about technical side of clothes - fabrics, care, quality etc.	labels:I learned a lot of it from my mum/a book my mum had on household stuff inc. A huge section on laundry and clothing repairs. The rest is from looking up how to make or care for things online. Learning to knit helped!   I learned hand Washing in university when our washing machine broke and the landlord didn't fix it for 3 months. I couldn't afford to keep taking my every day clothes to the launderette so I had to learn how to properly wash different things in the sink. Turns out it isn't difficult. Tedious but not difficult if you dont have mobility problems.	episode_done:True

text:Hair accessories - professional or should be saved for casual environments?	labels:Depends on the work environment and the type of accessory.    I work in a super casual work environment (WFH).  Even I wouldn't wear my cat ear headband unless I didn't have any video calls that day.    Now if I were in a BigLaw firm, things would be different.  Maybe I'd wear my hair half up using a plain silver clip but that's about it.   Or I'd use a tortishell claw.	episode_done:True

text:As a Canadian I refuse to get rid of my skinny jeans. Half the year is spent surrounded by snow, slush, and gritty slime. I have to tuck my pants into tall boots. I remember when flares were super in when I was a kid/young teen and all my friends and I would be wandering around with these sopping wet pants slapping around our ankles. Never again.	labels:also canadian - i feel this on a deep level. it was the WORST textural feel too. wet denim is a huge no from me. glad other people get this and aren't giving up the skinny jeans.	episode_done:True
text:When did skinny jeans go out of fashion?	labels:skinny jeans haven't been on trend since at least 2015-2016 imo. that's when mom jeans became all the rage.  That being said, skinny jeans are pretty much staples for most people. They go with a lot of outfits and make a lot of looks.   Just because something isn't currently on trend, does not mean it can't be stylish.

text:To go on a total side-rant here, isn't it nice to be able to carry all this stuff?? I don't carry as much as you but I really like having lip balm, ibuprofen, and kleenex with me at all times. Women often complain about the sexism of pockets (and that's legit) but can we also recognize that it's nice to be able to carry all this handy stuff all the time, which is totally socially acceptable for women and not for men?	labels:Yes, for sure - I‚Äôd be lost without half this stuff, and in my opinion, these are such handy items that a lot of people would be hard-pressed to find in an emergency type of situation and would be appreciative to have. Pockets are great, but there are definitely limitations.	episode_done:True

text:Wardrobe not updated	labels:What makes sense for you, your life, your budget, your mental health, your storage space etc? These are questions I consider for myself.¬†  Following fashion trends can be fun to engage in, but I'd recommend asking yourself whether you follow the trend because you like it or you feel societal pressure. Are you doing it for yourself? If so, is there something else you could be doing to substitute that would cost less money,¬†use up less space, last longer, etc?¬†  I've acquired a few things since Covid, and the later purchases have been way more mindful than what I bought initially. I've been investing more time into hobbies I've been meaning to get back into in lieu of online window shopping mindlessly. You see more things to buy, you'll likely have more urges to shop.¬†  It does feel like my wardrobe is in a time capsule-- more so the idea of "these are clothes I wore pre-Covid" and now "these are the clothes I currently wear." In a way, things feel dated because they are no longer in active rotation. But I don't feel the need to get rid of things I like. If I no longer like them, then there's no reason to hold onto them.  I bought warm clothes for the winter and I've been very grateful. I don't pay a lot of attention to trends as an indicator for what I should buy, but rather if I like something then I might invest time into finding the right version of x piece. But lately... I can't justify too many purchases and that's okay! Enjoying trends vicariously is just as good as owning something.	episode_done:True

text:Your favourite men's style shopping "hacks"	labels:Go through your wardrobe minimum once a year. It helps me to have a 4 tier system.  A - Cothes I like, wear, and fit me well. I have worn them recently and would wear them recently again. These are my go to.  B - Clothes I like but might not fit perfectly but still wear. These are out of rotation but just don't get worn as often. Could also be sort of like a specific situation sweater, these I would hate to lose.  C - clothes I want to sit on to give another chance. If I don't end up wearing it in a season/year/whatever period it will get donated  D - For donate/sell. Don't wear or don't fit. No use in taking up space for something I don't like or may have not held up so well. If you can get money back great but I also say have a time limit. You don't want to hold onto it because it doesn't sell.  I also kind of have a category for gifts/memorable occasion clothing. And that just helps me know, hey I am visiting a friend who got me a shirt let me wear the thing they got me. Might not be my style but I do try to hold onto these for a least a little while.	episode_done:True
text:Inspo Album: The Fun Coats Club	labels:I have a midi length faux fur coat that I found at a Buffalo Exchange in Chicago. It was purchased for NYE in Vegas two years ago, but it remains one of my favorite purchases. I still get compliments when I wear it. I had to carry it home from Chicago and then back out to Vegas and back, but it was totally worth it.	episode_done:True
text:People who used to play super safe with fashion, how did you overcome your fear of bold choices?	labels:I wear it at home. So I can get used to it without others seeing me. After a bit I suddenly feel more comfortable.   Also, avoid mirrors! This helped massively when I was trying to get comfortable wearing bright lipsticks.
text:I super agree with wear it at home, especially with the pandemic. Since March I've been wearing those more out there blouses and outfits that I bought but have been usually too nervous to wear. I work from home rn so waking up and picking out an outfit has been a fun way to keep some sort of routine. I feel good wearing them when I (sadly rarely) go  my partner to get groceries and the like. Now the final step I think is wearing it out one day when I meet up with friends and folks I know again.   For whatever reason I just dread the comments of "oh wow that's new" or "dang all dressed up" but in reality it's not a big deal. People won't have seen me irl in basically a year so what better time to say I changed things up	labels:About the comments from others, this was one that I struggled with for a long time. I think it‚Äôs important to think about any and all other reasons that may have led to them making those comments. Honestly, I think it‚Äôs more likely that most people say that kind of stuff because they‚Äôre searching for a way to start a conversation and that‚Äôs all they could quickly come up with it. Not necessarily that they wanted to point out or judge your choice in clothing. It‚Äôs also relieving over time to push away the feeling that you‚Äôre obligated to explain yourself. If that‚Äôs not the conversation you want to have, simply say yep or thanks and move the conversation along :)	episode_done:True

text:People with an over the top personal style, how do you incorporate it into your day to day?	labels:As someone who dresses like an absolute nut job I have learned that generally speaking as long as your outfit is overall appropriate for the situation, you can get away with murder. Like I wouldn't wear a sequined micro mini or ballgown to my office job, but I would absolutely wear a velvet suit and a bunch of brooches. I have also noticed that when I wear pieces that I love, my confidence increases throughout the day. Sometimes I have moments in the day where I look down and think "dang, this outfit is cool and I feel cool!" Those moments just give me a boost of confidence all on their own. The last thing is that people are generally too busy with their own lives to notice what you're wearing. They're doing them, so do you and have fun with it!   edit-words

text:Your thoughts on leopard print (and animal prints in general)	labels:For the longest time (like 15 years), I hated all animal prints. I found them tacky, loud, cheap...the same connotations you had, basically. They had their moments in fashion now and then, but even when they were in fashion, I never came around to them. I think it may also partly be because someone I know growing up had a LOT of animal print in their wardrobe and house, and I became sick of it at a young age. Hatred of animal print was the one aesthetic feeling that stayed consistently with me for *years.* I was very accepting of most trends, but this is the one I could never bring myself to like ‚Äì so I eventually shrugged and accepted the fact that I would always despise it.   AND THEN?????????? randomly a year ago, I suddenly found myself really liking leopard print, snakeskin, and croc skin (in small doses; I don't think I'll ever enjoy it on large pieces). They had come back into fashion, but unlike the previous times they'd cycled into fashion, this time I was suddenly feeling them? I really can't pinpoint why. It just happened. Maybe I saw some really cute outfits and ways to style it that I'd never really considered before. But either way, I bought pointy-toed leopard print pumps (with a really stunning dark golden velvet base!), leopard print slip-ons, croc skin slides, snakeskin sandals, and a snakeskin bucket bag. I thought these specific animal prints suddenly looked really cute as accessories!   So now I'm basically a-ok with leopard print, snakeskin, and croc skin. But I still really dislike zebra print for some strange reason. Not sure why this one still irritates me, and who knows, maybe one day I'll come to like this one too! But for now, zebra is a nope. And tiger print is horrendous and cheap to me.	episode_done:True

Have fun buying a shirt or pair of pants in your new sizes but your body might still be changing shape and your taste and confidence in clothing with it. Vintage is a good way to go if this is your first time really branching out into fashion.  Second, don‚Äôt overcorrect for slim fits. Mercifully the super skinny fits trend is over and I wouldn‚Äôt be too self-conscious about not having muscles. I‚Äôm tall and slim, but a too-right shirt can still look like a sausage casing.

text:Down Jackets	labels:Maybe not the MOST stylish brand for some but, I've really liked my Feathered Friends Eos down jacket. I mostly use it for winters in Montana where it can reliably be in the negatives on my way to work. Couple mornings we were like second coldest on earth that night at -30F or so. But this thing is crazy warm and extremely light. It's 10.6 oz with 3.7 oz 900+ fill SUPER lofty Canadian down. Premium stuff. They also have other more robust expedition jackets and parkas. Again maybe more of a tech piece than a "flex on 'em" type jacket but I think it looks as good as any Patagonia down jacket. Also gotta add, these guys are the best in terms of their ethics and sustainable practices. They were one of the first adopters of the Responsible Down Standard which ensures the down isn't live plucked and is humanely sourced. And they are made in Seattle, WA (and Vancouver, B.C. now) since '72. Not a paid advertisement lol, just really dig these guys.  \*They also have bedding, pillows, and more famously sleeping bags that are top notch.	episode_done:True
text:Stockings vs Tights vs Leggings	labels:I wear leggings, tights always run from rubbing against my boots but at least with leggings I can just shave the pills off. I get jersey ones and it doesn't feel like I'm wearing anything at all, and since they're pretty roomy they don't slip down. The bathroom situation is kinda annoying but I'd have to do that anyway if I wore pants.	episode_done:True

text:Can we discuss how uncomfortable it can be to dress fashionably sometimes? Must beauty = pain? Looking for comfort tips!	labels:I think you can still look fashionable while ignoring heels etc.   I agree with you on heels, and my foot shape finds them quite uncomfortable, so unless they‚Äôre a platform or quite chunky (like with most booties), I just don‚Äôt do them.   Now, I personally love high waist (the higher the better, gimme that steve urkle shit üòÇ) but lower waist, softer fabrics, or even high quality leggings (like faux leather styles) will look much nicer than sweats.   Well-fitting basic t‚Äôs look great. They just need to fit properly across your shoulders and chest. Plenty of flat shoes exist that look nice. Vans, leather or leather-ish ballet flats, nice sneakers (e.g. New Balance or similar) with a well-tailored outfit.  Honestly a lot of it comes down to the fit of clothing, the FABRICS (I mean, put on anything pilled and it looks ü•¥ immediately), and other styling elements like hair. Hair thrown into a ratty bun with sweats and uggs? Yeah I look sloppy. Straightened hair with joggers and vans? Now I look stylish! Ha.  ETA: that unfortunately body type also comes into play here. There have been quite a few posts detailing how basics look ‚Äútimeless‚Äù and ‚Äústylish‚Äù on thin frames, and sloppy or unstylish on larger bodies. I thought I would throw this in there just in case, although I think most of my comments still apply regardless of body size!

text:Shinies From the Past - or, What to do with Gifts from Past Relationships?	labels:I just went through this - I held on to two beautiful gold Tiffany necklaces and a diamond solitaire bracelet from an ex of 6 years.

text:General Discussion - October 27	labels:I think early MFA and the attendant blogosphere it spawned / belonged to / helped popularise is partially to blame for the whole "timeless" nonsense.  We've come a long way from "well dressed men wear suits" to "actually shirts and blazers can be dressed down" to "actually you can wear what you want and look good", and maybe the whole "timeless", "dapper", "classic", "gentleman" thing was a necessary part of the journey, but... would it just fucking die please.
text:There was a reddit shower thought awhile back about how Dads are like time capsules because they wear whatever was popular / in style when they had kids... as if they just stopped buying clothes and keeping up with trends once they had the first kid.  It seems like mid-20s/early-30s white guys in tech are the same. Based on what they're wearing, you can tell when they first started paying attention to how they dress. And they're all convinced that whatever they wear is timeless or classic, without recognizing that they just bought in to whatever was trending at that time (menswear, minimalism, streetwear, etc.) and that they already are starting to look dated.	labels:I agree. I just think that this partially resulted from how we used to "teach" fashion by some sort of quasi-scientific approach, with all the infographics etc. on how "clothes should look like". Everyone got a dose of post-hoc rationalisations on why the fashion of the day is "right" and it is difficult to move past that. Cf. the whole thing about slim fit being the right fit.
text:Look at every post/Q about spreadsheets or color wheels or apps or whatever... people want to take something that is fundamentally about taste and aesthetic and make it objective and rules-based. Them confronting the fact that this is impossible is very difficult for them.	labels:I've seen that in other advice subreddits as well. Latching on to "rules" makes it easier both for advice receiver (easier to understand) and easier for advice giver as well.  It leads to a reinforcing loop where a newbie shows up to ask a question, is given a rule from an "enlightened newbie", and then turns around and parrots that rule to the next newbie.	episode_done:True

text:Is Y2K fashion coming back organically or is it a result of progressing the 90's comeback to the next decade since that trend seemed to work out?	labels:Everything eventually comes back in fashion.  Personally I would love for 2000s jeans to come back - not super low rise or the ones that were bedazzled or laced up but just normal rise bootcut and flare jeans. I have a few from that era that I still wear all the time and a couple more that I had to replace with similar ones from poshmark because I couldn't find them in shops.  I also miss 2000s makeup. Sure, there was too much body glitter and candy colors but there was also the fresh dewy look of blush and a light lip gloss - think Britney Spears in her Oops I Did It Again video, or Mandy Moore's makeup in her video for Candy. Not everything in the 2000s was horrible lol.

text:Boba's Ultra Basic Steps For Developing Style and Outfits (version 1)	labels:I've taken a couple of laps before writing this comment, but up-front I think aesthetics section should be split, because I think the most basic question, which is answered aesthetically but not functionally, is what do you want your clothes to **do**? Giving off a vibe is mentioned, but there's an even more functional level of "are these clothes sensible for how I live my life?" Are you buying lots of hawaiian shirts even though live at the north pole, or buying down parkas when you live in Hawaii? Do you regularly find yourself cold and wet because you don't own any raincoats, or find that your fishnet sleeves keep getting caught on the mill in the machine shop, or that your raw denim really doesn't give you the flexibility you need to dance?   I think what the clothes do should meet you where you do what you do, and at the most basic level that's physically enabling you to do things, and you can build a vibe from that.
text:While I agree with you, I don‚Äôt think a large segment of of the world aspires (strongly at least) to dress vastly different from what makes sense to Wear in their climate. I don‚Äôt think there are guys who work at the factory and dress up in bespoke suits; they‚Äôre smart enough to discern context.  Even urbancomposition, a union electrician, is able to dress how he wants, and that means dressing for his context.   I also think figuring out your aesthetic is also finding how to mix context with what vibe you want. Cotton knitwear turtlenecks exist, so you can definitely wear a roll neck in LA (within reason). There are cotton flannel aloha shirts that are long sleeve.  You can have a linen over shirt or a flannel overshirt. Open weave, high twist wool suits exist as much as flannel and tweed. Flannel lined chinos are a thing.  Apart from drastic things like wanting a to wear outerwear, there are definitely ways to make a personal desired aesthetic work for your context.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:What work for my boyfriends taste and body type?	labels:My husband has a very similar body type. When he got a new job recently in a larger city after working from home for years we basically went out and got him a whole new but fairly minimal wardrobe that‚Äôs worked out really well for him.  We picked out a color palette for him which is mostly blues/navy, gray and olive green. He had a couple of basic button downs like a plain white and a crosshatch pattern in various shades of blue. We picked him up a few more button downs in various classic colors like white, light blue, white with a simple pattern of any of those colors. We also got him a couple of more casual button downs, either because of fabric or a louder pattern for fridays or casual wear. J Crew button downs ended up fitting him well. I agree with other recommendations for slim fit jeans and chinos; we replaced his light wash Levi‚Äôs 501s with dark wash slim fit Levi‚Äôs 511s and those look great. Banana Republic‚Äôs traveler pants are also a favorite for him, fit and good stretch but look sharp.   For outer wear we got a couple of basics: a grey fleece vest like from Patagonia for the ‚Äúmidtown uniform‚Äù look; it‚Äôs more comfortable than wearing a blazer but still looks more formal than a button down on its own. I also got him a quarter zip navy merino wool sweater to layer over his dress shirts on colder days. More casually he has a lined flannel ‚Äúcoat‚Äù that he wears over a basic white tee, a more tech jacket, and formally I found him a basic black wool overcoat for work.   For shoes we got him one pair of nice oxfords, one pair of oxford looking tennis shoes from Cole Haan, a pair of off-white leather shoes as his dressier items.   He also has hiking pants and brown hiking shoes that he wears as casual clothing with sweatshirt tees or flannel.	episode_done:True
text:Do you: 1) keep all of your wardrobe equally diverse, or 2) keep all of your wardrobe minimal, or 3) keep some pieces relatively similar while diversifying others?	labels:I have evolved some classics I keep- I admit I dress a bit like a children's book illustration character from the first half of the last century meets femdom faerie sex witch- so it's a lot of simple collared blouse under unornemented cashmere sweaters, black opaque tights, solid saturated colours largely in jewel tones, positively ridiculous big hair bows and then flip flop into corsets and strapy, or lacey things.    I go through periods of realizing a 34 year old wearing thigh highs with maryjanes is confusing and periods of comforting myself that the lesbian in clarks and stripey socks look makes me happy and as an elder-millenenial I am basically a generation adrift.    Probably the hardest part is realizing I don't have to buy new clothing. Like, I have enough of most things and it doesn't wear out fast enough to justify replacing it, nor does it really no longer spark joy.    I have stuff that fits from college that still has *years* of wear left. Unless I gain another 20lbs more than my natural yoyo, or suddenly take up a physical job, basically only socks, shoes and underwear will need updates from just material failure.	episode_done:True

text:Does anyone else not factor in pants when creating outfits? How to move away from this?	labels:YES. I've never paid enough attention to pants in my wardrobe until about two years ago. I mean, years ago when the mom jean/boyfriend jean became I thing, I did hop on the train; but mom jeans and skinny jeans were really the only thing I had, never really paid attention to pants that much. UNTIL TWO YEARS AGO. PANTS CAN SAVE YOU FROM YOUR BORING PANT-LESS LIFESTYLE AND ELEVATE YOUR SOCIAL STATUS.  Well, this was the case for me, at least.  I started with ambitious rips. Then I got more into the loose/baggy jean look. Then I got into joggers, straight-leg, wide-leg, balloon pants, cargo, sweats, patterned pants etc. Now I have a wide assortment of pants that fit every vibe, every minuscule emotion, every single hormone that possesses me that day. Now I'm just a huge pants fan. People are always complimenting me on my pants. Everyone by default pays more attention to what is worn on top when planning an outfit, but when the BOTTOM is factored in -- WOW you really know what you're doing.  There is nothing wrong with skinny jeans -- they're versatile in nature and really can go with everything. But it can get boring quickly. A strong, multi-dimensional pants game can elevate your look and wardrobe. I really do recommend looking at the pants on Aritzia, for example, Or Hailey Bieber's/Kendall Jenner's outfits. I tend to rely on Pinterest a lot for ideas and inspo.  PS. Many times have I failed in my pants journey (bought pieces that were actually quite ugly/didn't work/unflattering/one-time wear kind of thing). BUT BEAUTIFUL PANTS IS A JOURNEY AND A PROCESS. I'd start simple (like a wide-leg or mom jean or patterned loose pant) to ease yourself into a different pant-style. And once you feel more wild and comfortable, explore more.	episode_done:True

text:What bag(s) are you eying for Spring/Summer 2021?	labels:Anyone have a wandler bag and can shed some light on the quality?   I am majorly lusting after the Bvlgari serpenti bags. They are fairly inexpensive for the quality of leather (compared to a chanel/gucci). I was in store a while back and they are seriously even more beautiful in person. They had a bubblegum pink one with the serpent on it and I want it so badly! I highly recommend everyone google their bags as I think they are less popular than they should be. I also like that they are less popular because they look like a super good quality bag but only those ‚Äúin the know‚Äù so to speak, will know where it is from!   I am also curious about hunting season bags. They have piqued my interest a bit as well.
text:Gosh, that Serpenti bag is gorgeous. If I could afford it right now I'd be agonizing over whether to get the black or that gorgeous green! Some day...  (I see we have similar tastes in general. I've been wanting a Wandler bag for years!)	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What are your feelings on thrifting from ‚Äúproblematic‚Äù brands?	labels:The company already made money off of the original purchase of the shirt, so you buying second hand doesn‚Äôt really benefit them in any way. If you really want the item, buying it second hand is probably the most ethical choice you can make. If someone asks where the piece is from, just say you don‚Äôt know so they won‚Äôt be tempted to buy from the brand lol
text:I partially agree with you. But the company still benefit from second hand purchases.   The second hand price is based on supply/demand, buying the unethical brand even second hand shows demand and increase public perception of the brand then prices go up. That‚Äôs why some brands are still more expensive than others even in thrift store.  Yet if you like an unethical brand, like you said, buying second hand is better.	labels:Postmark and eBay are full of people who intentionally sell for secondary market. Might be worth looking into Goodwill online or something like that.
text:if we're talking about ethical shopping tho, isn't goodwill like.. not great ? i used to shop there all the time and the local goodwills have some of the best selection, but i've read that they exploit employees with disabilities so i don't shop there anymore.  please correct me if i'm wrong btw, but iirc they consider disabled employees "volunteers" and don't pay them.	labels:You‚Äôre pretty close to right. They consider job training one of their charitable activities and use an exception to the minimum wage that allows them to pay below minimum wage to people who are disabilities, sometimes as little as cents an hour. This is intended as ‚Äújob training‚Äù, but in truth employees rarely leave these jobs. And, imo, it‚Äôs absolute garbage exploitation of workers with a guise of helping them. They also have been in some allegations of having a dangerous workplace. Not trying to shame anyone and tell them they can‚Äôt shop at Goodwill, but since I can I try to go to other thrift stores. If anyone wants links, lmk and I‚Äôll get them when I‚Äôm off mobile.	episode_done:True

text:What I Like is Not What I choose to wear	labels:What I like to look at and what I like to wear are not the same thing. I actually think a lot of fashion struggles come from people not understanding how to separate what they find aesthetically interesting from what meets the specific needs in their life.  When you look at a photo of an outfit, you're not *just* reacting to the outfit itself. You're also reacting to the body of the model, the styling choices (makeup and hair), and the photography decisions (the pose, the location, the lighting).   I might look at a photo and think "that person looks so cool in that outfit," but that person isn't me. I would not look that cool in that outfit because I'm a completely different person.  When I choose clothing for myself it needs to satisfy my aesthetic tastes when paired with my body and the amount of effort I'm willing to put into styling (i.e. zero), as well as suit the needs for my daily life. That's actually a limited number of options for me.   But when I am admiring an outfit or a photo, I'm not constrained by my hang ups about my body or the needs of my daily life. I can just like the outfit without having to contextualize it around myself, which is actually quite nice.  So, personally speaking, my interest in fashion isn't limited to clothing I would choose to wear. I find it's much more freeing to allow myself to enjoy fashion and outfits without always questioning whether I would like the outfit on my own body.
text:This is a Good Comment.  Especially the part about reacting to the model's body and styling as well as the items of clothing. And man, it can be real tough to come to terms with that sometimes. Having a cohesive style certainly helps with the styling aspect in these situations, but the part about the body is rife with stress and emotion for a lot of people. There's no one right way to deal with that. Everyone just needs to find the line between what they like and what they actually want.	labels:	episode_done:True

In the summertime I prefer the same colors just a lighter shade of them.

In shoes I prefer flat ones, mostly sneakers,Oxford shoes, or platform shoes.

text:How different is your actual heel length vs what it's advertised as and, how much does it change by shoe size for you?	labels:Something I‚Äôd like to point out, as a former dancer (yes, that kind of dancer), who spent several years wearing various heel heights:  In my experience, the slope and comfort of a shoe is partly dependent upon the height of the platform. The higher the platform, the less of an impact a high heel makes.  Both of the shoes in your photo have a thick platform. I think it would be helpful to deduct the height of the platform from the height of the heel, as that would give you a truer measure of the impact of the heel height.	episode_done:True

text:Favourite places to get your fall wool fix?	labels:Don‚Äôt forget to check out thrift stores. This is where I stock up on cashmere sweaters for a few dollars a piece, wool skirts, kilts, sweaters, vests, and cardigans, and amazing wool blazers and coats. I‚Äôve found mint condition mohair and camel hair 3/4 coats for as low as $10, black cashmere sweaters for $2-3 and up, and cable knit pullovers for as low as $4. It‚Äôs amazing what people get rid of, not realizing how expensive it all is new. I also loooove wool in the fall and winter, and so this has been a super affordable way to build a dream cold-weather wardrobe.   The only thing wool I buy new are socks for the most part, everything else I‚Äôve found at estate sales, garage sales, and thrift shops. When/if you go, definitely go through the boys and men‚Äôs departments, too. A bit of tailoring can make anything look custom like some of the pieces on Walker Slater maybe.
text:Yes! Second hand for sweaters all the way. I buy some sweaters from Poshmark. Because they can be so ageless, we can find pretty nice pieces from a few seasons ago, or even decades ago, and it'd still look current.   The only issue is old sweaters could have shrunk, look tired, or even felted, or come with holes. I returned two Poshmark pieces because they literally had undisclosed moth holes in them, lol. So always be careful about buying quality wool online.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Lessons from a Year of No New Clothes	labels:Love your post.  I recently-ish got a sewing machine and am making myself only wear stuff I make.  Sewing can be an expensive hobby, however, I feel the clothes I do make would be less expensive than what I'd buy because I tended to go for nicer brands or linen sellers on Etsy (which can cost a pretty penny).  So, overall, I'm spending less money, have a new fun hobby, and it also makes me be more intentional with what I make since I'm not the fastest sewist.  Edit: also, in addition to unsubscribing to sale emails like you mentioned, I also moved all my shopping favorites in my browser to another folder that was annoying to get to.  I didn't want to delete it in case I do need a new winter coat or something (and can't remember brands). But this has really helped my window-not-really-shopping.	episode_done:True
text:How does one incorporate haute couture into everyday work outfits?	labels:I don't own anything that's truly haute couture, but I'm sort of a collector of independent, higher-end fashion. I'm a stay at home mom right now, but I LOVE the idea of mixing high and low pieces together. I also think there's nothing wrong with just going all out and letting a piece shine. I have actually displayed fashion pieces that I love in my home, especially when I can't wear them on a daily basis.  I have a beloved Rachel Comey wool purse with a drawing of a nude woman on it, and I display it on a mannequin in my bedroom, so I can see it everyday. One day, I'll carry it to the store, lol. I also have a Suno NY skirt that is way too small for me, but I bought because I loved the fabric pattern. I've draped it over a shelf or used it as a pillow cover to display it where I could see it.	episode_done:True

text:What age did you start pinning down your style? And how many times has it changed since then?	labels:I was gonna say now, but I actually I had a pretty good idea of what I liked around 16.  I was low key obsessed with J-fashion, specifically Gothic Lolita, most my friends were all emo/alt, as was I, and I was reading a lot of Vogue, so I had good trend awareness, and balancing all those things to make outfits that worked was a lot of fun.  I had two distinct phases after that.  The first was that kind of aggressively flattering/appropriate style that a lot of people develop in their early twenties, which was a compliment magnet, and was also a lot of fun.  After that I had a phase that wasn't really so much a style as it was having a retail job and no strong preferences.  I wore some fun items, but there wasn't much cohesion, and it eventually made getting dressed feel like a chore.  I got tired of that in 2019, did the big chop, started my closet overhaul, and pretty much got down to writing myself a rule book, since I knew what I liked and wouldn't get sick of wearing. (Also, I tend to forget anything not written down.)  Turns out, most of that was based on what I liked in high school, and the handful of things that stuck since then adapted to my life now.  I genuinely like black, and am fine with only a handful of other colours I can wear head to toe.  I like a simple, compliment magnet of a shoe.  I enjoy a fun print or a ridiculous statement item- just in a limited colour palette.  I had my exploratory phase and didn't particularly care for it, so outside of life changes or new fashion loves, I don't see any drastic changes in my future.	episode_done:True

text:How did you curate/purge your wardrobe specifically for moving? What pieces did you bring when moving to a drastically different climate? What other fashion moving tips do people have?	labels:When I moved from a very hot climate to a super cold, snowy one I was in a weird place both financially and with my wardrobe. It was supposed to be extremely short term but ended up being long term/possibly permanent, which definitely messed with my expectations for my wardrobe.  Eventually I got rid of all my "warm weather" clothes for various reasons, mostly size/style ones, and when I was able to started to stock up on winter wear. I didn't know what I liked so I just kind of went for it. For example, I thrifted tons of scarves only to barely use them a couple years later because I realized I only like infinity scarves. The same thing happened with multiple categories because I was so desperate to fill the missing chunk of my wardrobe.  I agree with the advice to wait as long as possible before making drastic changes. Its hard to know what you'll actually end of needing, much less what you'll like or enjoy using. See what you can pick up secondhand to try out styles that suit your new climate best before investing a lot of money or time into altering your wardrobe.	episode_done:True

text:Who else has sensory issues that has figured out ways to not dress boring?	labels:ADHD pal here. I have also fallen prey to the "it was fine when I tried it on, but now I'm at the office and it is torture" paradigm. I have had to force myself not to compromise and to trust my gut, first off. If it doesn't feel good between my fingers, it doesn't even make it to the fitting room.   When I find something that works for me, I buy up as many as I can in different patterns and colors. This goes for jeans, trousers, tops, etc. - I own like 7 St. John's Bay long-sleeved mock necks because I KNOW I can always depend on them in the fall and winter. I also really like a specific cut of Banana Republic pants. Poshmark is great for this, but I also just keep an eye out whenever I stop into a thrift store. I know that I prefer soft, drapey fabrics, tops with looser midsections (none of those wide-banded bubble top things), and high-waisted pants (just as a few examples). It has taken a while to be able to consciously name and identify those qualities, but now that I have, shopping is getting easier and more successful.   Learning a few quick hand-sewing alteration skills is also helpful. I can choose a top a size too large and then take it in where needed so that it still fits and flatters but doesn't restrict where it would cause discomfort, or I can do the same with a pair of pants (I often size up and then take in the waistband).  I think it's just a lot of trial and error plus not being afraid to develop a uniform of key foundational pieces that you know you can depend on building an outfit/wardrobe around. Accessories can also go a long way toward breaking up the superhero/cartoon character monotony - belts, scarves, earrings, necklaces, headbands, hats, etc. can all really change up a look (depending on which of those do or don't work for you and your sensitivities).
text:You are describing it perfectly. It feels fine at the clothing store probably because I'm so excited about how it looks and the atmosphere of the store. I avoid malls like the plague for this reason. Then I go to sit down for a long period in the office and I'm realizing how weird and sweaty the fabric makes me in certain parts on my body or the seams are rubbing me weird at random times in the office.   I have one pair of Aritzia pants that I love that have a stretchy band on the back. There's a sale right now, I think I'll just get a few more pairs. I used to like some stuff from Banana Republic too but the last time I went into the store, I found a lot of their shirts had poorly made seams, it made me really sad. I also used to love the JCrew that was not at the outlet but that closed down because their outlet business killed their regular retail.  My whole journey with this is the realization that ADHD can make me appear not serious because of my tendency to talk like my head is on shuffle and talk too much. Works great for my specific job, it's like a superpower. However, I do think I have a tendency to come off as a slob or not serious on occasion. I realized I need a bit of contrast in how I present myself to the world instead of just resorting to hiding. With my medications, I can actually get up and get ready without feeling overwhelmed thinking about all the steps of putting on makeup because there's no direct consequence to me not wearing makeup even though I love it.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:I think of how most people used to work physical jobs all their lives, and as they aged, their bodies would be shaped by that work - whether muscular, sinewy, bent, etc.  Nowadays though, honestly the dad bod is the same thing.  I'm older than the average redditor and I think of all the people I've known who would rather be moving around more, but have spent decades at a desk because that's what our economy is and because they love and want to care for their families.  That work shapes their bodies in a different way.  My dad went from young & chiseled to old & paunchy as he worked and paid for most of our house, food, education, etc.  So this whole "REAL work vs desk work" thing hits a little hollow for me.  I do think that exploring the sociology behind trends can be very interesting - perhaps we ARE pining for the time when we wore chore jackets to do chores.  But while I'm pretty sympathetic to a lot of legit "haves/have nots" type discussions, this article doesn't hit the mark for me.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:General Discussion - November 27, 2020	labels:Hot take: speaking from experience, fetishistically optimizing the most basic of basics (e.g. "the best plain white t-shirt") for maximum imagined value is not a meaningful nor worthwhile exercise. Your wardrobe is not more interesting because your white tee is better than another white tee, and by the time you've found the 'perfect' piece either the prevailing trend or your own preferences will probably have changed.  'Perfect tee' threads are usually highly-upvoted, but the answers have drawn from the same pool for the last goddamn decade:  - *Vintage/workwear (generally heavier, boxier, shorter):* 3sixteen, Buzz Rickson's, Lady White Co. - *Streetwear (generally lighter, slimmer, longer):* Reigning Champ, wings + horns, John Elliott - *"Normal" (somewhere in the middle)*: Naked & Famous, Arket, American Apparel when they still existed - *Edgy goth shit:* Rick Owens mainline for lighter and DRKSHDW for heavier, Kazuyuki Kumagai Attachment, Voidthebrand when they still existed - *Budget*: Muji, Uniqlo, Everlane, Bella+Canvas, etc., but no one really cares  It's functionally a solved question. You can pick one from the applicable list for your style, and it'll be *fine.*

Beware items that have this kind of photography, because most of the time it means the garment has bad construction, weird seam placement, or unfortunate details.  Well constructed items are not shot in this manner. Brands want to show off their excellent construction. It is known.  Hope that helps!

She ended up being a super emergency c section, and I‚Äôm still processing how scary and unexpected that was, but she is super healthy and doing great. When I got pregnant I was worried about balancing parenting with my professional goals, and now I know she‚Äôs only going to add great things to my life.

text:Learning to dress better	labels:Seems like the info in the guides would have been useful. Do you have specific questions beyond that?  As far as the hair questions, I think it matters a little bit. Hair color affects which clothing colors will be most flattering on you. Outlandish hair styles may clash with conservative attire, while conservative hair styles may clash with edgy alternative attire. But it's possible to toy with the contrast deliberately. For example, Hardcore, Teddy Boy, Lo Head and early Skinhead styles incorporated elements of "smart" (sort of business casual) attire, but recontextualized with bold hairstyles and subversive styling. Best preppy-styled guy I knew shaved his head. It's not what you expect from the clothing, but I thought that it helped him make the look his own rather than a class costume.  So I'm mostly saying don't overthink the hair thing. Hairstyle is probably more personal than clothing, so just choose a style that you like and that suits you. If it's not harmonious with your clothing then tweak something or enjoy the contrast.	episode_done:True

Also I like the combination of plain turtleneck and fun patterned pants :) by the way I have an Instagram where I take pictures of cool styles I see on the street, it‚Äôs @adoquinculture if you want to take a look for inspo.

I also bought a ring as a gift from the Etsy shop silvertraits and the packaging was so incredibly nice when it arrived, I was thrilled to give it as a gift!   KhanivorClothing is a great one too if you like the artists they have, the seller was really helpful when I had a sizing issue.
text:Oh wow I just checked out @gypsetco and my wallets about to start crying	labels:The business owner seems like such a lovely woman too, she‚Äôs really transparent about how much each sale means to her, how each product is literally handmade.

I‚Äôm tall-ish but also apple shaped and broad shouldered with narrow hips and no waist. (Also officially overweight, thanks quarantine)   I think what helped is that i started following a lot of OOTD accounts from people here on ffa from waywt and the midsize and plus-size style hashtags on Instagram. These helped me normalize seeing confident, stylish people in different sizes and now if/when I try to emulate their style, I‚Äôm less disappointed.

text:FAQ: How do I pick out my first suit for professional internships, interviews, etc.?	labels:I think that an under-discussed part of picking out a first suit for these types of things is getting out and trying them on before you buy. Being comfortable in a suit, even if it‚Äôs cheaper or in a less fashionable cut, is more important in interview settings than the eye to detail and quality that we normally discuss on here. A suit that fits in the shoulders, in a neutral color like navy or charcoal, that you know fits because you were able to try it on is way more important to your success than ordering something online that might be objectively better. Interviewers are looking for you to meet their minimum standard of professionalism, not for you to wow with with sartorial taste. Source: had a lot of interviews in college and law school.
text:This is super important. When people talk about "making sure a suit fits" they're usually talking about how it *looks*, rather than how it *feels*, but both are important.   One of my first "adult" suits was a really basic, cheap OTR suit I got when I was about 22. It technically fit my body and when I asked others for their opinions on the matter (including fashionable friends), they all agreed that it fit me well, and I looked good in it. There was always some nagging issue with it though that I could never put my finger on. I only realized after owning it a couple years that the pants rise was about an inch lower than the rise I wear on my jeans and chinos. It wasn't "low" mind you, again, it technically "fit" fine, but it's not the rise I'm used to and the rise I like the *feel* of on my body.  Some issues with "fit feel" can be fixed with tailoring, but others can't. If a rise is too high you can probably get it shortened- if it's too low, there's probably nothing you can do about it. Always worth keeping in mind that a little extra fabric can be reduced, but if something is pinching, pulling, or hugging you a little too close, you might have the wrong garment on.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Is Chanel going to be better off without Karl?	labels:I feel like Karl Lagerfeld's legacy & tenure really glossed over his last decade or so of design. Sure there were some good shows in the 2010s, but a lot of it was just....   Virginie Viard is always going to come up short because she's Lagerfeld-esque and has the misfortune of coming directly after Lagerfeld. Lagerfeld was good at making his name and Chanel synonymous so that if you see a tweed jacket - you immediately think of both. As Viard tries to draw upon Chanel classics & house standards, it's seen as copying Lagerfeld (and failing) rather than her being referential. She hasn't really presented her point of view, separate from Chanel or Lagerfeld, either, so it's really hard to pick up on the specific aspects of her designs that are *hers.*
text:It seems she has spent her whole career under him, that she hasn't had a chance to spend her wings and develop her own point of view. The question is will she get that opportunity at Chanel - or will she need to leave to find it.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Are your glasses part of your style?	labels:I have at least 20 frames.  Some of them are no longer my prescription but I don‚Äôt want to get rid of them. I buy them from zenni but also wherelight and some other places. They are most definitely an accessory because sometimes I need them to stand out more or less depending on my outfit.   My eye doctor has me wearing progressive lenses now so the price has gone up significantly on my everyday glasses so I don‚Äôt have the same selection I used to. However, I can see just as well out of my $60 zennis as I can out of my $400 frames from the eye doctor.	episode_done:True
text:Are our ideas about what looks ‚Äúdated‚Äù on either ourselves or others affected by or correlated with our age?	labels:Yes, I do think our age definitely affects what looks dated to our eye.   I‚Äôm noticing that some younger men are wearing some strange iterations of 80‚Äôs color-blocked track suits that to me look very Golden Girls. Also, I‚Äôve seen shirt and shorts sets on rappers made out of wild print fabrics exactly like the ones I made for my toddler 25 years ago.  I‚Äôm older, so I‚Äôve seen a lot of trends come and go. We are now at the point where they are starting to repeat and are designated as ‚ÄúVintage‚Äù.  I have cultivated my personal style over many years (boho/western), and have seen it done well by Ralph Lauren and most recently Christian Dior in 2018(?) and enjoy the idea of wearing the beautiful things I‚Äôve collected until the end of my life.
text:I agree - having seen several decades of fashion, I‚Äôve come to the conclusion that If I can remember the trend the first time around, it is dated and not for me.  I don‚Äôt mind incorporating newer trends only if I like them, but by 49 I mostly know what I like and what is flattering.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:What I Like is Not What I choose to wear	labels:What I like to look at and what I like to wear are not the same thing. I actually think a lot of fashion struggles come from people not understanding how to separate what they find aesthetically interesting from what meets the specific needs in their life.  When you look at a photo of an outfit, you're not *just* reacting to the outfit itself. You're also reacting to the body of the model, the styling choices (makeup and hair), and the photography decisions (the pose, the location, the lighting).   I might look at a photo and think "that person looks so cool in that outfit," but that person isn't me. I would not look that cool in that outfit because I'm a completely different person.  When I choose clothing for myself it needs to satisfy my aesthetic tastes when paired with my body and the amount of effort I'm willing to put into styling (i.e. zero), as well as suit the needs for my daily life. That's actually a limited number of options for me.   But when I am admiring an outfit or a photo, I'm not constrained by my hang ups about my body or the needs of my daily life. I can just like the outfit without having to contextualize it around myself, which is actually quite nice.  So, personally speaking, my interest in fashion isn't limited to clothing I would choose to wear. I find it's much more freeing to allow myself to enjoy fashion and outfits without always questioning whether I would like the outfit on my own body.
text:This makes a lot of sense about the life you lead vs what you like to look at. I really like looking at crisp, clean looks, but right now I‚Äôm home with a baby, and when I‚Äôm working I‚Äôm a teacher who needs comfortable clothes to move around in and that can be washed easily. I also hate to iron. Crisp white button downs and heels aren‚Äôt going to cut it.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:London street style Inspo (circa 1985-1990s)	labels:As everyone is saying, this could be today. I was especially struck by the girl in the carhart vest.  Even more so because the clarity of the photos sets it apart (visually) from earlier vintage looks. If it weren‚Äôt for peripheral details like the cars, cigarette boxes, amount of garbage on the street, etc. I wouldn‚Äôt be convinced this was 30 years old.  Kind of interesting to compare with some of the outfits and haircuts in the backgrounds, which seem more typical for the era.

text:What did your mom teach you about fashion/style - and what did she not teach you?	labels:If I picture my mom's typical winter outfit it was a sweater with snakes wearing sombreros and margaritas embroidered on it, a burgundy "sweater jacket" with fringe, and a pink/orange/green bucket purse.*  So I guess she taught me "fuck it, wear what you want", but it did take me a while to adopt that attitude.   *tbf, this was a look for moms in the 90s
text:That sweater sounds amazing.  source: am mom.	labels:I really didn't appreciate her taste enough. One thing I did steal from her were a pair of earrings that are just dangling wooden parrots. I did like her Christmas party uniform, which was a long navy dress, a cream colored military style jacket, and block heeled sling backs.  The 90s really were a trip.

text:Your 2021 trend predictions?	labels:I think we'll see an adjustment on the enormous puffy sleeves and ruffles, and a trend towards fitted long-line pieces - still historically inspired but with more of an emphasis on ornamentation than on silhouette. Nods to the roaring 20s: gems, jewels, metallics continuing to be prominent; dramatic makeup; heels making a resurgence.

text:Women who have revamped your entire wardrobe ‚Äî how did that go? What is your advice for the rest of us?	labels:My advice to my past self would be:  GO SLOW. However slowly you think you‚Äôre going, it‚Äôs still too fast. Find one piece that you really love- beautiful color, perfect fit, quality material, in a style you like- before even thinking about more.  Trying to plan an entire wardrobe (even a tiny one) and then trying to shop for the plan, just landed me with a bunch of stuff that wasn‚Äôt quite right. Going slowly, piece by piece, helps to make sure I‚Äôm making a good purchase rather than something rushed, trying to fill a perceived wardrobe hole. It‚Äôs also helpful, because if you go slowly one piece by one piece, you‚Äôll also be doing ‚Äúwith as few pieces as possible‚Äù, and can stop when you have what you need and love.  My second point of advice to myself would be to stay off the internet, focus on what I actually like for myself, and not get distracted by all the pretty things on all the different people.	episode_done:True

text:Jeans: Recommendations and Reviews	labels:Honestly I think you have to give way more detail on your old pair and what you‚Äôre looking for.  In my mind the biggest hurdle to perfect jeans is the fit, and since every body is different this is highly individual. Some people might prefer stretchier denim for a more forgiving fit, while others look for stiffer fabric, and have less leeway.   Personally I still struggle to find a high rise, non cropped, fits my thighs and waist, plain dark wash, straight/skinny, 90% or more cotton, pair of jeans. But hopefully I‚Äôll find it eventually!

text:Is anyone else intimidated by maximalism? I love it, but how do you do it?	labels:I think I'm in between here. Not minimalist, but not maximalist. The one maximalist thing I'll do is with either accessories (scarf and jewelry and a hat and funky boots) or one bright/bold piece like a colorful jacket. Like, I have a mustard, navy and pink paisley jacket that I'll wear with jeans and a navy top, but I don't really have the stones to wear pink shoes and a green hat *also*.  Maybe try this on a smaller scale instead of attempting a full-on look?	episode_done:True

text:Are there any alternatives to a suit that you know about or your culture uses?	labels:>If it was a professional standard to wear shorts to work instead of suit pants, would we be buying designer thermal work shorts made out of wool?  We probably would. Comfort is not the only constraint on clothing ‚Äî we also must consider what will send the proper message across. If you want to look like a competent professional, in most industries the way to do that is to wear a jacket and tie. There is no way around this; it is entrenched. The important part here is not what *you* think of your appearance, but what *the other person* perceives about you *based* on your appearance.  Attempts to wear other cultures‚Äô formal attire will 1) look very strange, 2) not send the desired message to the other party, because they probably won‚Äôt know other cultures‚Äô clothing, and 3) require explanation if you don‚Äôt want people to think you don‚Äôt know how to dress. In short, it‚Äôs probably easier simply to endure a bit of discomfort (or buy nicer clothing) than it is to try to change the cultural perception of business attire.	episode_done:True

text:Creative pragmatism light	labels:This style is surprisingly attainable for me after several years of hardcore minimalism. Once I got to a place where my basics are both on point and super pragmatic, then I have been able to incorporate a few Tibi and Tibi-like statement pieces into my rotation. I‚Äôm no longer a minimalist in terms of style - I like buying a couple ‚Äúbig impact‚Äù things every year to jazz up my clothes, especially oversized  or dramatic drape or ‚Äúorigami structure‚Äù on tops and coats. A single piece really changes an outfit and you don‚Äôt need many pieces in rotation to suddenly change your style. Amy Smilovic appears to do a similar thing - keep several things ‚Äúbasic‚Äù (neutral color, solid/no pattern, uniform texture, unadorned (no bling or fringes etc) and the play with one thing (her thing seems to be oversized fit and pleats).  The only reason I bring up minimalism is because I cannot emphasize more how much the basics being ‚Äújust right‚Äù makes my dramatic pieces work. Especially with oversized, it‚Äôs a thin line between slob and stylish. Those big pleated dad pants Amy Smilovic wears? The rest of the outfit should be sharp or you look like you simply don‚Äôt know how clothes should fit. Not everyone needs to first develop an ‚Äúunfashionable‚Äù base before reaching for both fashionable and pragmatic, but I did.   As for Tibi, I know them most for silks and for their origami shapes. GoSilk is a great option for patterned silk and Roksanda has the shapes. Ganni and Comme Les Garcons has some of the quirkinesses and oversized looks. But none of them are cheap either unless you score a good sale. If you can identify exactly what you like about Tibi, we can make more recommendations.
text:Can you please elaborate more on your "just right" basics?  I have been attempting to minimize my wardrobe and find that balance between creative expression and pragmatism for probably the last decade.  I love fashion, but live an active and semi-nomadic lifestyle that really demands a simplified and wearable wardrobe. Five or more years ago, this meant structuring my wardrobe around black leggings and a black stretchy h&m t-shirt dress. It worked for me then, but nowadays it feels both outdated and for someone younger than me.  I'm really trying to nail down the basics to make my \[often thrifted\] statement pieces look more elevated.  The other thing is that wearing tight bottoms and a loose or flowy top used to be fashionable, and it was ridiculously easy to style, at least for my body type.  Nowadays the silhouette has flipped (volume on the bottom) and I'm a little lost as to how to work that into a pared-down wardrobe.	labels:	episode_done:True

I just want to wear a ball gown once a year,  is that too much to ask?
text:As soon as Covid is over - throw one as a theme party!  One of my friends did this a few years ago, and it was SO fun!  A few of us wore our old prom gowns, a few actually owned fancy adult things like that, and the rest of us grabbed fun formalwear cheap from Goodwill!  Some guys wore suits if they had them, some wore just a dress shirt and nice pants, etc.  Some people also came in jeans and a t-shirt, it was no big deal and the dress-up stuff was just for fun!

text:I own a pair of cashmere sweatpants and I never wear them. For some reason it itches and irritates my skin more then tops.  I wear the viscose/cotton mixed knit more.

text:What do you like, fashion-wise, about loose-fitting clothing?	labels:I have always preferred dresses and skirts to wearing pants; however, I find that they can make a person look "overdressed" in a more casual setting. If I wear a loose-fitting or oversized dress then I look like I put some effort into my appearance without being too dressed up. I also love oversized/loose-fitting pieces with weird structural details or unique drapes. Sometimes these pieces are not necessarily "flattering" per se but I enjoy them because they are comfortable enough to get shit done in while still looking somewhat interesting. I agree with other commenters, sometimes you want to draw attention to your clothes rather than your body parts.	episode_done:True
text:What are your tips for being stylish when your weight fluctuates like crazy?	labels:Sort your closet by size so you know what's there that'll fit you.  Get a pair or two of pants that fit you whatever size you currently are, and are decently forgiving. (stretch or elastic waist or joggers with a drawstring)    Wear some fun eyeshadow and mascara and a cute mask. Your personal style isn't limited to the neck down.

text:Victorian, but Make it Fashion - Fashion Week Spring 2021 Inspo Album	labels:Thanks so much for this! This is the first season I have been really excited in a long time. So many of the outfits seem like they were inspired by social distancing, But would that give the designers enough lead time? I don‚Äôt know enough about industry to answer this question.
text:Aww I'm glad you liked it! I personally don't know enough about the industry either to know what time of the year designers start to work on their collections but reading the accompanying articles of the shows, many designers sighted social distancing/work from home/comfort as being key aspects they sought to incorporate into their collections so I believe you're correct!	labels:	episode_done:True
text:How to combine colors	labels:Having read a dozen of these articles, I'm not about to read a dozen more, watch multiple videos, et cetera.  The most obvious flaw in most articles I've seen on this topic is a broad lack of photos. In some others, the flaw is that the photos in no way illustrate the point.  I skipped through one of those videos. It briefly showed the woman being made over in black, and then, at the end of the video, in green. Most of the video seemed to involve large amounts of makeup, which I don't entirely understand -- won't heavy makeup change her skin tone, thus fighting the practice of trying to match clothing to her skin tone? Strategically manipulating one of these things in light of the other two is one impossibility -- strategically manipulating all three variables at the same time serves no experimental purpose, and, in the end, still doesn't really seem to make her look much better. She just goes from being a slight goth to an ordinary woman. Perhaps there would be a point if I bothered to watch the video, but I doubt it.  Is there an article you have that illustrates its point visually? Not just writing out a point and putting irrelevant pictures next to it, but actually having relevant pictures that make the point clear. Don't give me another list, because I would just pick one at random again -- please, just give me one good one.
text:>She just goes from being a slight goth to an ordinary woman  Highlighting this because I‚Äôm almost positive this is the point they were making and what they mean  by ‚Äúmore attractive‚Äù  She goes from ‚Äúnot normal‚Äù(bad and ugly) to ‚Äúnormal‚Äù(good and attractive).

text:How do you feel about vegan/faux leather?	labels:There is no such thing as vegan leather.  There's leather, and then there's plastic that has been manipulated to immitate leather grain.  The latter has its uses--it's cheap, it can be made in literally any shape,  it can be made waterproof and insulating, and it certainly isn't *ugly*\--but it's certainly not leather.  Personally, I try to avoid it.  My reason are as follows:   1) It doesn't have the durability I need--it  loses its shape easily, it hardens and cracks easily, and unlike leather it is almost impossible to repair once damaged.   2) It doesn't have the sustainability I want--sure you spare an animal's hide, but you could wear out ten pairs of PVC shoes in the time it takes to wear out one well-made pair of leather shoes.  Now you have ten pairs of PVC shoes floating in the ocean killing sea turtles and the cow ends up on a plate regardless.  3) Aesthetically... it is cheap plastic.  And it looks like cheap plastic.  There are some styles that can accommodate or even luxuriate on cheap plastic items, but mine is not one such style.  There is simply no replacement for the depth of color and texture given by leather.     4) Chafing oh god chafing     That said, I've seen some folks look really good in PVC.  I used to look really good in PVC too, back when I was more wild and reckless.  But now that I've become the sort of person who gets her materialist thrills out of vintage copper cookware and exotic tea blends, I find I am also someone who really loves the beauty and comfort of leather.  You can call it an Old Fart Thing if you like.	episode_done:True

text:When will I be "too old" to look cute, cool, hip, whatever?	labels:36 year old here, grinding my teeth at you for asking this question at 22.  This is my constant internal monologue, but I think that it is always appropriate to try and present yourself to others in the best possible light.  I can't tell you how things will change for you, but I have found that my tastes have developed and age has sanded off the fringiest edges of my fashion interests.  I used to want to (relatively) keep up with trends, and now my aesthetic goal has shifted into a desire for a more timeless look; probably because at 36 I would also like to be timeless.  So at the end of the day I hope to dress like someone that wears quality clothes, with a flattering fit, and they indicate that I care about my appearance.  And I don't think you're ever too old to fit that criteria.  The fact that you're asking the question probably means that you are introspective and will adjust your style as well.
text:Also 36 and you summed up how I feel exactly.   I moved from a big city to a smaller blue collar city a few years ago, around the same time I had my first kid. Balancing my style with my surroundings and the demands of being a Dad is super tough. I always felt too dressed up at school drop offs etc. And I always question if I'm trying too hard.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Style rut: Pinterest vs reality	labels:I think 'fashionable' and skinny/ white/ young etc. get confused a lot. A young, thin, white conventionally attractive woman wears and oversized tee and some leggings and its a 'look', and if I do that I've given up on myself.   I also think the overall styling of a look plays into whether its fashionable or not. A lot of the people you see on pinterest/ insta are wearing tailored clothes or have the photos edited or the clothes pinned at the back to make it look perfect. Hair and make up are also a part of how 'done up' you look.   Also, its not okay for people to be making comments that are hurtful even if they're not intending to hurt you. Its okay to say you're not okay with that.

I wouldn‚Äôt purchase an article of clothing with a fake logo, for instance, but that‚Äôs me personally.)   I also find that fiercely anti-knockoff attitudes can become classist very easily. And the topic of ethics in this regard really gets to me, too. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs fair to criticize the ethics of consumers in a rigged economy.

I have my original diamond & platinum set, plus an eternity band in yellow gold that I wear when I‚Äôm wearing yellow gold jewelry and an emerald cut eternity band that I wear when I wear my emerald cut three stone right hand ring.   My birthstone is emerald so I have several pieces with this stone. My son‚Äôs birthstone is sapphire so I have both a blue sapphire ring and a yellow sapphire ring.   Casual jewelry is yellow gold usually - hoops in various sizes, bangles, gold chains & pendants, my Tiffany bold T ring in 18k is one of my fave pieces to wear for a minimalist look. I also like the Mejuri slim dome ring for this as well.  I do have pearls - a vintage strand that was my grandmother‚Äôs and I have matching pearl studs plus black pearl studs.

text:I want to be that bada*** biCTH (Ik it's spelt wrong, it's meme bro lol sry. Plus idk if we can swear, I don't post) tl;dr at the end cuz I tend to rant :)	labels:I'll start with #2. I started shopping for my own clothes around 16/17 . My family don't really care what clothes I buy with my money as long as my closet wasn't bursting at the seams.  I sometimes get the "are you really going to wear that/buy that" when they see me in something new. I remember buying a pair of wide legged, long jeans, and wearing sports bras as tops. Maybe it's because they saw how happy and comfortable I was in them that they didn't try to put me down for wearing stuff like that. What I buy is with my own money anyways, which does give me more confidence in some ways and probably helps them accept it too.  I know you mentioned ripped jeans -- I know some ripped jeans can cost, like, $150-$300 a pair. My advice would be to buy it with your own income (if that's possible, I know you aren't even 18/21 yet) and purchase things that you want to wear AND feel confident in wearing. It really sucks to spend money on items that sit around collecting dust.  My story with #3 is that people around me are either 1. creative energy or 2. dress with a similar vibe to me. I try to play a game -- if I'm going out in something "basic"/very messy, it's to blend in and likely not to talk to anyone that day. If I'm going out in something I love wearing, it's because I love it and I want to share it with the world. So I welcome the stares (and the questions). I try to match what I'm wearing to a purpose or mindset for that day. I value my own productivity more than how I'm being judged for something so shallow: my outfit. So my advice would be to find a purpose for what you're wearing, a purpose that is strong and way more important than how others might judge your outfit.  Honestly, I found that finding and building my style (which is really just a collection of stuff I will wear often) was a combination of having some financial independence and buying pieces that I loved to wear. Best of luck to you!	episode_done:True
text:Is 2020 the year of the 'house dress?' On comfort as a 'trend'.	labels:I‚Äôm a fan of the muumuu and wear baggy dresses regularly.   For me, ‚Äúhouse dress‚Äù is something that either isn‚Äôt good enough to wear out (too ratty/thin) or something loose enough to not constrict and not so fragile that I worry about ruining it doing light chores. The latter gets worn outside the house regularly.

text:how often do you wash your clothes?	labels:I wash underwear, socks, masks, leggings, and tank tops (I wear one under most outfits for smoothness/sweat!) after each wear. Outer layers like sweaters, hoodies, etc after three or four wears. Jeans after four or more wears‚Äî can usually tell by how they feel and fit that they‚Äôre ready for a wash.  Bralettes when they start to smell!
text:Same. I started washing my bras a little more frequently because I noticed the straps discolor after 3-4 wears. I do have two elementary age kids, and I wash their jackets (along with masks) after every time they play outside (double masked) with a couple of friends in their pod.

text:FAQ: How do I know my clothes weren't made with slave labour?	labels:As others have mentioned--you don't. The best way to avoid it is by thrifting since you're not adding to the demand for clothing production. A thrifted item could have been produced by slaves originally, sure, but your purchase of it doesn't contribute to that.  Also, contrary to what you might assume, in many cases companies that have gotten into trouble for abusing slave labor in the past are actually safer now. They overcorrect and invest in auditing to avoid the issue happening again. This only applies to companies who care about their brand in this way though, like Target.	episode_done:True

text:Permanent Style - The Cold-Colour Capsule	labels:See, I'm confused. In what sense are blues not the coolest colors? Why does this guide almost entirely exclude navy? In what sense are brown, black, grey and cream cold?
text:You know how audiophiles all make jokes about how meaningless the terms used to describe sound are because sound is so hard to define in that way? Same thing here, ‚Äúwarm‚Äù and ‚Äúcold‚Äù are very loose terms that probably mean something a little different to everyone.   I can see the argument for grey and cream being cold, brown can be warm or cold depending on the shade, not sure if I‚Äôd agree with black.	labels:Now *that's* an argument I understand. Although I still think the way he's communicating is strange. I think he means tonally neutral, bland, desaturated colors. "Cold" is a really strange way to say that, whether or not the term is technically ambiguous.
text:>I think he means tonally neutral, bland, desaturated colors  I would argue that‚Äôs what cold means, while blue is generally cold, I don‚Äôt think cold means ‚Äúmore blue‚Äù, it‚Äôs more about the relative saturation and intensity of the color, basically you have to judge what makes a certain color warm or cold totally in comparison to other similar shades, not as a general sliding scale of ‚Äúbrown is warm, blue is cold, always‚Äù, though, like I said this is all a semi useable way of describing it.  Going back to the audio examples, I always see vinyl described as sounding ‚Äúwarmer‚Äù than digital, when I first heard albums I knew on vinyl my first reaction was ‚Äúwow that sounds really different‚Äù, immediately followed by ‚Äúwow, I _definitely_ wouldn‚Äôt describe that as warmer‚Äù, so, I do get the confusion	labels:Exactly, which is best exemplified when Simon talks about certain blues being warmer (more saturated) vs cooler (less saturated)	episode_done:True

text:Sorry you feel that way. When I wrote it, I tried to convey that I didn't put much thought into what I wore. Perhaps I could have said pajama bottoms with RRL cardigans. I don't have a perfect description for it, but I do think that the style Andrew is wearing there is a lot more coherent. I think there are ways to do that style thoughtfully, and not randomly.

I haven‚Äôt decided what my next purchase will be. I want to get myself something that will make me excited to be alive, and I‚Äôm looking forward to finding that thing.

text:Crazy theory here - but has anyone noticed that sometimes stores say the item is now sold out? I‚Äôve done this a few times only to come back and the item is gone. But when I sign out it magically is there. I feel like there are a few retailers that use this as a tactic to not ‚Äúwait too long.‚Äù	labels:The "almost gone! Only two left but three people have it in their cart! Sale ends in 01:03:29" types of messages are in fact just marketing. They're designed to create a sense of urgency and fear of missing out, which then triggers the impulse to buy without further evaluation.   Remember how you used to see furniture stores with "going out of business" sales that never seemed to actually go out of business? It's the same thing: people think they have a limited time to take advantage of a "deal" that might never return and are more likely to buy. That particular problem was so pervasive that U.S. law changed to ban that as a bait and switch/false advertising scam.  There are tons of ways that businesses use psychology to entice consumers. Everything from the color of the walls to the height of a shelf is done with a specific purpose. Same thing applies to websites.

My parents were so angry I spent all the money I had on one single clothing item but I still have the sweater about 10 years later and it continues to be a staple item

text:Women that work labor jobs, what parts of your wardrobe are most important to you?	labels:/r/BlueCollarWomen might be of help here.  I split my time between the office (well, from home) and field work. For boots, I LOVE my Carhartt 6" composite toe hiking boots. I tried construction sole boots for a hot second and decided I have better traction with hiking boots. Red Wings has several women's safety toe shoes as well  For pants (again of the more cargo/field variety), I love 5.11 Tactical. They have women's cargo pants that are durable, actually cut for those of us with an ass, have useable pockets, and have a *hammer loop*. I bought one pair, tested it out for a month, loved them, and went back for 2 more.  As for looking professional, polo shirts are the default, but not particularly fashionable. Tailored fit button down camping shirts might be worth looking into as well. I'm not much help here because any time I'm meeting non-company personnel on site, I'm probably wearing company branded outerwear.
text:I am between an office and field also and I find good comfy boots, and comfortable base layers such as cami, t, and ‚Äúlong underwear‚Äù in the winter.  It makes a difference, I wear a uniform so it is pretty ‚Äúlite‚Äù on make up and jewellery, but I work on a simple but nice job on my hair as it is also quite long and needs to be tied up high!.    If I need to be at a more professional or less ‚Äúuniform‚Äù I will bring if I have to travel that day or while on course, I will take a few button ups , a nice blouse, and dress pants or skirt and tights.  As it is a toned down environment, it means classic but cute, so a nice set of earrings, classy but simple make up and a few muted accessories., a really cute classic skirt is easy to travel and pair it with a variety of shoes will work nicely.  It is a bit of a hassle bringing more clothes as well as shoes but it is often business casual.    I try and go a tad more than chinos and a polo if possible as I do not dress up often and it is a fun mix up.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:How do you know when something doesn't fit perfectly?	labels:You can get a suit jacket or blazer tailored. It‚Äôs so important to make sure the shoulders hit right where they‚Äôre supposed to, and that any buttons on the front can be properly buttoned. A suit jacket that doesn‚Äôt fit properly looks unprofessional. Sleeves can definitely be shortened if required.	episode_done:True

text:Indoor layers	labels:For clarity, because I think I get where you‚Äôre coming from‚Äîare you saying that the outerwear makes the outfit complete, so you‚Äôre wondering what people do to complete their look after they‚Äôve taken off the coat once indoors? I‚Äôve often felt like this while scrolling through Pinterest and wondered the same.
text:That's how I interpreted the question as well.  The "third piece" rule pretty much would have you to put a third piece on top, and in winter, that third piece is a coat, and once you are inside you don't wear the coat anymore.  For me, I typically have an indoor third piece waiting for me, ie a neutral color cardigan at my desk, so when I take off my kickass outerwear I can still complete the look with a third piece for indoors.  If that's not possible for whatever reason I'll wear the indoor third piece under the outdoor third piece because if it's cold enough to wear the winder coat, a thin cardigan isn't going to seriously mess up the temperature calculus.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Brooks Brothers's Future Looks a Lot Like Menswear‚Äôs Past	labels:* Less SKUs. The amount of stuff BB sells is overwhelming.  * Do away with there weirdly named fit system. Change it to Extra Slim, Slim, Regular, Thicc Daddies * Revamp the BB website. It's been terrible for a long time. * Have the athleisure stuff, but also focus on high quality basics, again with less SKUs. Have something like an "essentials" line. The Navy Suit. The Charcoal Suit. The OCDB. The Chino. The Wool Trouser. Without fifty million variations thereof. You go now and it's like here are three navy suits with different kinds of stretch, here are four more with some kind of temperature controlling fabric. Just give me a half to full canvas lined 100% wool navy suit in various fits and sizes. In other words, simplify your menswear line to cut down on SKUs, and that will give you more room to play with sheep on skis and stuff (i think that does sound kind of cute, very Ralph Lauren). * Do away with Golden Fleece, Red Fleece. Mainline only. Again confusing to the consumer. * Where BB could play more is in areas like sport shirts. By all means offer your classics like blackwatch etc., but other menswear shops like Sid Mashburn or Todd Snyder offer all kinds of fun prints and colors while still feeling like classic #menswear.  i dunno, just riffing my own personal desires for BB. i don't know anything about running a large clothing manufacturer and retailer.

text:Ordered from Shoe The Bear (rant, experience in post)	labels: On Cyber Monday 2018, I bought a pair of Suede Chelsea boots from Shoe The Bear and they're one of my favorite pairs of kicks. Fit was awesome, quality was amazing for what I paid (~$70). I've worn these boots 100+ time and still holding up great.  Fast forward to this past Cyber Monday. I wanted a pair of cognac/brown colored Chelseas from Shoe The Bear. They arrived within a few days fron Portugal. I was so excited to open the box....and they are completely the wrong color.  They're so far from the correct color, customer service is claiming that I treated the leather myself and they don't carry boots in this color.  To say this experience is bizarre is an understatement - No, I did not treat the leather. I took the picture within minutes of opening the package because I couldn't believe what I received. I'm going to try and return them but now they're claiming I treated the leather so who knows what will happen.
text:In Europe you have 14 day return policy on everything without needing to give a reason (im guessing youre in Europe since it came within a day from Portugal).

text:Good point. Im guessing the EU regulations are to be disregarded if the buyer is in the US. I have now seen "30 days return" in the website banner in the screenshot so given cyber monday was Nov. 30, it leaves more than enough time to get a return...	labels:Depends on a few things. They're accusing him of treating the leather with something that changed its colour, so they aren't accepting a return on that basis.  Most credit cards have built-in consumer protection so if you call your credit card company they'll typically refund you and go after the retailer. However, they do keep track of how often you do this in case you try to abuse it.

Those are divided again into spring/summer and fall/winter (obviously there are overlaps, I'm ok with these.)   Dresses, blouses, blazers/jackets, skirts, and dress pants go on the hangers; tees, sweaters, and jeans are folded. Socks, underwears, and scarves go in the drawers.

text:BoF: J.

(though i think that has more to do with being able to capture an on-trend aesthetic.)
text:I'm a J. Crew loyalist, so I'm acknowledging my potential bias but I'm also a fan of Banana Republic and went through a hardcore BR phase. However, I've kind of forsaken Banana (my young professional wardrobe was full of it) and returned to even more J. Crew -- I've found that, in general, my pieces from J. Crew last longer and hold their shape/quality more than what I have bought from Banana. Also those 50% sales are usually goldmines for me! Just my experience!	labels:I loooove BR - they‚Äôre in my price range and their clothes just fit me well - but quality is absolutely hit or miss. I have stuff I‚Äôve had for years, and I also have a dress that I wore twice and then a ribbon on the back just fell off haha. But for my budget, if I‚Äôm picky, I do very well there.

I put this together from my existing wardrobe, since we didn't want to spend a lot. Covid measures made things a bit weird, but the court officer made a real effort into making it nice, which was great.

text:Does anyone else use a ‚Äúformula‚Äù to create their outfits?	labels:I don't have a system per se. Rather, I have a kind of "capsule" mindset for my wardrobe: not too many statement pieces, and everything in my color palette (black, grey, Ivory, Navy, taupe, blush). I honestly haven't had to think about an outfit in years (outside of accounting for the weather). I can pick up practically any blouse, trousers, jacket, and accessory and they are almost guaranteed to match. I do find myself gravitating to layers (sweater over a blouse, cardigan over a top, etc) but I'm not too specific about it and I usually just choose whatever sounds most comfortable.  It works so well that I started doing this with lingerie too -only buying my lingerie in black, blush, or nude.

I'll dress up just to for a fire in someone's backyard. But on the upside, getting dressed just to sit at home gives me a lot more confidence to try things I wouldn't have tried before and hopefully will be more comfortable wearing when restrictions lift.	episode_done:True

text:How do I know if my sense of style is really mine or is it defined by others?	labels:In art school, we learned about finding out own aesthetic. Finding it involved copying others' work for a while (never for profit, btw). We learned how to develop our own hand in this process, what worked for us and what didn't. In turn, our aesthetics became really a combination of several other artists.   I think fashion and style is the same. There's influences of who we follow, but the more we try and experiment, determining what works for us and what doesn't, is when our unique style will emerge - and it'll still even then be a combination of several other styles. Experiment, figure out what's important to you in your own style. It takes time and intention.	episode_done:True

text:Rant - I'm fed up with fashion and "expressing myself"	labels:Have you thought about uniform dressing? I'm not talking about a boring black t-shirt and jeans every day. I wear a dress, sweater, and black pair of shoes every day. In the winder I add tights/leggings and an ankle book (summer is black sandals). I never have to think too much about what I wear and I don't really have to make any decisions after I purchase the item. My dresses are really comfortable, all of them have pockets, and I get compliments constantly. Uniform dressing sounds really boring, but you can create a fun and unique type of uniform if you want.  I tried a capsule wardrobe earlier this summer. It had dresses, shirts, pants and shorts, but I went back just dresses because the capsule was too many decisions. I just pick a dress that is clean and move on with my day, but I also still have a distinct and unique style.
text:I have what I call my "base layer," which is a black shirt (t-shirt or long sleeve, depending on season) and black bottoms (pants or leggings).   Then a colorful sweater or jacket on the top, plus a scarf and gold earrings, and I'm out the door.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:MFA Theme WAYWT: Casual Tailoring	labels:This stuff looks great and the idea is nice in theory but after years of attempting this and being ‚Äúthat guy‚Äù, it really doesn‚Äôt work outside of the largest/most fashionable locales (NYC, London, Paris, Southern Europe, etc.). If you really want to do this and are comfortable with it then by all means go ahead. But from my own experience I did this, and actually did it fairly well after many years, but at the end of the day it stood out too much in real everyday life in a normal town, regardless of how nice the outfit was, and it definitely hurt my social reputation a lot. After toning it down a bit I immediately noticed a difference in how much more positively I was treated by people. You can still dress well, but remember context is key.
text:Are you sure your execution wasn't just shit?  I mean, yeah, wearing a light structure blazer to grab groceries is silly, but... *hurt your reputation*?	labels:At the time as a young 20-something, yes.

text:Does AGE really effect your choice of Fashion - Clothing Trends (Discussion)	labels:My perspective is from someone who got interested in wearing sport coats, ties, and ‚Äúprofessional‚Äù clothing at 17. I just turned 24 and only now do I feel like I have a solid grasp of fundamentals to try new stuff after 8 years of taking clothing seriously.   To me, it all depends on what you want to communicate to others. If you‚Äôre only dressing for yourself, you can wear whatever. If you‚Äôre more conscious about what others will think too, then there‚Äôs an element of ‚Äúdressing your age‚Äù for societal acceptance.   The reason why people shit on 50 year olds wearing hollister is because it‚Äôs so apparent that they‚Äôre trying so hard to recapture their youth rather than accepting their age and what positives come with it. In the same vein, 17-year-old me wearing ties and sport coats was me trying to shed my youth and move too quickly into professional adulthood. Both have to do with fighting against what we‚Äôve been given rather than working with what we‚Äôve got in a natural way.   The issue may be one of standing out from the crowd being frowned upon, but I think it has more to do with the underlying mentality and reasons why people chose that look.	episode_done:True

text:How does one incorporate haute couture into everyday work outfits?	labels:More info needed: What luxury designer* pieces do you tend to fall in love with? If evening wear or voluminous skirts are what makes your heart beat faster, there might not really be a good way of bringing that into your 9-5... but if you‚Äôre drawn to something like Balmain blazers (a personal weakness), it‚Äôs a lot easier to just throw one of these into your work rotation in place of a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù blazer. If you‚Äôre into a particular brand‚Äôs prints, textures, use of color, etc., then accessories are an easy place to start as well - a full blown Pucci dress may be a bit ‚Äútoo loud‚Äù for an engineering firm, but you should be able to get away with a silk Pucci scarf.   *Assuming you meant fashion house runway / main line pieces, not true haute couture which is really not work-appropriate unless you‚Äôre a model or actual royalty...	episode_done:True
text:What are your not-so-basic basics to pair with statement pieces?	labels:For the suit, I'm picturing a hot pink crop top underneath to go for a full monochromatic look, but with some more minimalist heels.

text:1 Year - A Kmn6784 2020 Wardrobe Album	labels:I love this. I am currently working on overhauling my entire wardrobe because of two reasons:  1) I outgrew almost every single shirt and sweater that I own because I started going to the gym 2 years ago and I don't fit a medium top anymore.  2) I used to only shop at sort of street style or skate style shops and that is just not the kind of look that I want anymore (plus those clothes don't fit anymore anyways)  Your wardrobe looks so great! I feel like you've got everything for any occasion, and I agree that it looks like you can just shop for whatever you **want**, rather than what you **need**.  I really like the Greats shoes that you've got. I never heard of that brand but I was actually looking for shoes just like those. I have a pair of vans and a pair of blundstone chelsea's, but I really wanted something in between; something that says: "I am here casually, but I care about what I'm wearing". I may get myself a pair of Greats!  Also, I noticed a lot of stuff from J. Crew. I have bought from them once, a Kashmir sweater, and it was actually kind of itchy so I almost never wear it. Should I give them another chance? It seems like it's one of your go-to places.
text:Greats are fantastic, They're a bulkier silhouette than Common Projects but no one would look at them and think "chunky".   J Crew started as one of my favorites because of their absurd sales and inoffensive basics, I don't have any issues with the quality of the items and like all my pieces from there. One specific item to highlight though, their linen shirts are crazy good for the price, easily my favorite cheap linen.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:I want to eliminate the need for dry cleaning my work wardrobe. Sadly, anything nice seems incompatible with machine wash. What long lasting, work pieces have been easiest for you to maintain?	labels:oooooh,so apparently my friends all consider me the laundry queen. I also have the strictest dress code out of all my friends. I will say that much of my wardrobe is machine washable,but even with those pieces I try to limit damage from washing. I have a couple of ways:  1. wearing more often and hanging up between wears to air out and limit wrinkling.  2. Depending upon the item,using an undergarment to protect from sweat etc.  3. Using a steamer to help remove wrinkles and refresh clothes.  4. If having to wash in a machine,gentle cycle on cold and air dry. I use a mesh wash bag for the most delicate articles. I find for a lot of "dry clean only" this method is usually ok.  5. For wools and silks etc. I use Eucalan.   edited to add: I don't really havs brand recs - much of my wardrobe is thrifted and even when I've gotten recognizable brands I don't think I'd be able to say with confidence if they were indicative of the brand's current quality.	episode_done:True
text:Distinct Fashion Phases	labels:I definitely went through a lot of style changes too!  Middle School- I wore what was ‚Äúin.‚Äù Tight t shirts from Aeropostale and sweatpants from Abercrombie.   High school- I geared more toward my current look. Jeans and t shirts, or dresses and leggings/tights if the weather allowed. I was very much an Ann Taylor/Loft fan because of their petite sizing. Sometimes I wore slacks and t shirts because slacks are more comfortable than jeans imo.  College (right now.)- I wear a lot of things similar to what you described as your current style! Not nearly as often as I‚Äôd like due to weather and dresses aren‚Äôt always practical. I did just get a bunch of new stuff from Collectif if 40s/50s vintage inspired clothes are up your alley. They have a big sale right now too! I also would check out shoes from American Duchess and Remix Vintage if they‚Äôre in your price range	episode_done:True
text:What do you guys think about sites like Poshmark and Curtsey?	labels:Love poshmark! I got really nice clothes (like a cashmere sweater) for a very good price. If your style veers towards what's on style at the moment, you'll have a harder time finding it/pay a good price. But mine veers towards simple/trendless/hint of vintage-y things so it's perfect for me.	episode_done:True
text:Experimenting With Different Focal Lengths & Landscape || Portrait	labels:70 is best in both cases imo, which is certainly the objective decision for a portrait focal length. 50 is fine, And tbh I‚Äôve take portraits I‚Äôm personally proud of on a 35mm full frame and 45mm equivalent on medium format film (actual lens focal length is 75mm) so it is certainly doable. I saw you‚Äôre on the Sony a7iii and if you want a portrait lens, the 85mm f1.8 is insanely good and not terribly expensive all things considered. I don‚Äôt do much digital shooting but I absolutely love the results of that lens. I‚Äôm usually real lazy and just use my phone, if I set up my camera I just use the kit lens set to 28mm bc I don‚Äôt have enough room in my apartment to use anything more.
text:I got to try the 85 1.8 from one of my friends and it was so fun to shoot with! I currently have a 20-70 and 50 1.8 prime, thinking of getting a 70-200 or similar for sports photography and maybe doubling it as a portrait lense. Thanks for the reply!	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Just how revolutionary is Harry Styles‚Äô Vogue cover?	labels:The article hit all the points I was thinking except one. Why Harry? Why do we all look at Harry Styles when talking about revolutionary men's fashion when there are so many others who've done it before and are doing it right now. Just a thought.
text:My theory on why Harry is this: playing with gender in fashion isn't new as you pointed out, eternal icons like Grace Jones have been there and done that. However, Harry's instance is unique because we have seen in a highly publicized way the evolution of how he sees his gender. He started as a (sorry fans) generic white musician with bland style and has since sort of aggressively redone his look. I'm sure he's been called "brave" in numerous articles documenting his steps towards this moment. Similar pretty boys like Ansel Elgort and even people like Post Malone have played with gender, but none in an as aggressively pursued and marketed way as Harry did. I also think people see that he has an X-factor because of his sexual identity. Billy Porter being a publicly queer person is sort of expected to do these things. Yeah his gown moment was highly publicized but it certainly didn't "break the internet" and spawn discussion like this did.  edit: also exactly what u/Anthraxistaken said	labels:I was thinking that too about how it was all because we've seen his growth and I couldn't have summed it up better.	episode_done:True

text:Anyone like wearing traditional clothing from you culture?	labels:I also love wearing my cultural wear! I was born and raised in the US, but my parents are from Vietnam. Our traditional dress is the √°o d√†i, and I just think it‚Äôs so beautiful. It‚Äôs such an elegant piece of clothing and literally makes any girl look good, no matter what size or shape you are. I‚Äôd love to wear it as part of everyday wear, but it looks a bit formal for most occasions. I have seen some more modern versions and a bit trendier versions, so I‚Äôm trying to get my hands on that. As for now, I just wear my cultural dress to church on Sundays, which is a more appropriate setting.  But I wouldn‚Äôt worry yourself about what your mom has to say about it. If it you like it and it makes you feel good, then why not wear it? I bet you look amazing in them, it sounds so cute!

text:People who work in the fashion industry - what do you wear?	labels:I work in the fashion industry, but within the tech org of a fashion retailer, which tends to be more casual than the rest of the company.   That being said, for being on the west coast (PNW), our tech org dresses much better when compared to the large tech companies in our area. Worth noting that with COVID and working from home, most people I work with are wearing solely athleisure now.   My role has to interact with our buyers and merchants quite a bit, so before COVID I tended to dress in smart-casual attire (think loafers, slacks, and a sweater ‚Äî or nice jeans, a blazer to dress it up, and some booties).  Our merch org dresses all over the spectrum of ‚Äúalways fashionable‚Äù ‚Äî where the lower employees tend to lean more casual and trendy, high-street fashion with maybe a few designer splashes, while upper management tends to wear a more business-formal designer wardrobe (think St. John style). Designer or not, people who work in the Merch org always seem to own their look and create a signature with it.	episode_done:True

I grew up in a family of so many girls who all feel like we don't know fashion. I always wanted to but it felt unobtainable. Well I went through some family stuff where I no longer need to be spending my free time and money taking care of some family members so I have been updating my wardrobe like crazy. I watched and learned about a ton of fashion for a month first with all the free time from covid. I have never spent this much on myself ever. Don't get me wrong everything was thrift store finds or clearence but I was still wearing almost only things from highschool before and I'm 25.. I extra splurged yesterday and was able to score a brand new pair of vegan doc marten oxfords for $45!!	episode_done:True
text:Style rut: Pinterest vs reality	labels:Okay, so people are heckin' rude. What inspires us can be unwearable on our particular bodies, and we're not obligated to wear it. Or maybe we don't want to wear that exact item, but some part of it excites us. It's okay to translate what you loved in a picture into something you feel fits into your everyday life. What gives with your "friend"?  Now, if you find yourself unable to do that -- you're STILL okay. And if you need help, obviously that's why Daily Questions etc exist. Because we weren't any of us born knowing how to style.
text:I love dusty pinks and mauves.  I cannot express how badly those colors look with my skin. I've had *strangers* ask me if I was ok because they assumed someone who resembled a corpse that much must be actually nearing death.   I love heels and very sleek business casual as well as what I can only call ho-fits. I have bad ankles fr from working on concrete floors too many hours, and take public transportation. It's too much of a risk I could sprain my ankle from how much I walk, and I can't afford another sprain. My office is not business casual or sleek, but a no fuss "just don't wear t-shirts with slogans or anything" type of place. I am decidedly over my ho phase, despite my continued love of the clothes.   My fantasy of wearing heeled booties with a structured fashion blazer over a mauve dress is not any less real just because I have the common sense to not go through with it.  Fashion fantasy is still a valid form of participation!	labels:I have gotten around that a bit by having decor in colours I look bad in. I definitely have some dusty pink throw pillows.

text:can you tell me the major difference b/w style and fashion?!	labels:One of my favorite quotes is by Coco Chanel: "Etiquette are for those without manners, in the same way as fashion is for those without style."  What this means to me is that fashion is a series of "rules" and transient ideas about what "good style" is, but isn't really a substitute for having your own well-defined, more solid and long-lasting style.	episode_done:True
text:What are some habits that keep clothes/shoes new vs that habits that ruin them?	labels:First for cardigans and sweaters is I either go fully wool or fully cotton. Can‚Äôt be any sort of blend, and I avoid mohair. I have a cotton cardigan from urban outfitters that‚Äôs like 5-6 years old and looks brand new, so you don‚Äôt even need to go super pricey, just look at fabric content.  Second is I wash everything on cold, and hang dry as often as possible. Heat basically transforms fabric, so using it is unnecessary. I also find that it sets pit stains instead of removes them.  Shoes I have no idea. I walk a lot and constantly wear out shoes. I find leather with a sewn in sole lasts a lot longer, but flats and heels never last that long. I‚Äôve also had luck with shoes that have wooden soles which I‚Äôve added a sole with traction to.  For bags, I‚Äôve always heard it‚Äôs bad luck to keep them on the ground, but that‚Äôs more superstition than keeping it nice lol.

text:Anyone else feeling incredibly disconnected from the 'fashion world'?	labels:I too am bored to death of the French classic look, the Tik Tok youth trends, the Everlane normcore.   Someone recently recommended Amy Smilovic of TIbi here and I‚Äôve gone in deep, haven‚Äôt felt this inspired in a long time.   On her + Tibi‚Äôs Instagram she espouses what she calls the ‚ÄúCreative pragmatic‚Äù look and articulates nicely many things, like what makes clothing ‚Äústuff or style‚Äù, does a lot of bolder silhouettes that somehow still work for everyday and uses styling to bring out personality.   Frankly, I haven‚Äôt seen anyone be so clear on why sometimes you buy an item you love that feels stylish but as soon as you use it in your daily life it just feels off or not as impactful.   It‚Äôs also been helpful for me to see for once how pieces are worn on actual people and not just models.

text:How do you shop in COVID?	labels:I worked at Kohl's in college and spent my fair share of time cleaning out fitting rooms.  In normal times, those are the grossest places ever (you don't even want to know what kind of shit I found in there-- including literal shit).    TBH the only clothes I've purchased since Covid were PJ pants (because my old ones split in the ass).  They were from Walmart (so I could go even during a lockdown).   Oh and I bought a sweater dress at Primark.  Now, most of the clothes I buy run SML as opposed to numbered sizes.  Even dresses.  I generally just hold them up to my body and pray that they work (and return if they do not).    I tend not to buy clothes online because the quality is so inconsistent from store to store (and even within a store).  I need to actually feel the quality.	episode_done:True

Doesn't necessarily have to be florsheim shoes, but any derby shoe in shell cordovan.
text:If I was gonna get a pair of derbies I‚Äôd go for any color other than black, especially if it‚Äôs in shell. Save black for more formal shoes like oxfords. Not saying that derbies are strictly casual or that they don‚Äôt look good in black, because they do, but if I was gonna get a black shoe it‚Äôd be an oxford.

If I did feel old I would probably tap into my creative side and find a way to incorporate the style to my comfort level.
text:Agreed. I‚Äôm 31 and I LOVE some of the current trends out there. I just style it a bit differently to fit the needs of my job/life and comfort level. I might focus on colour and material over cut, or get the cut in a less overt colour.   There‚Äôs only so much longer I can maintain abs. People can pull the crop tops out of my cold, dead, hands.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:How do ya'll express your culture or traditional fashion in modern clothing?	labels:I‚Äôm Vietnamese, and I‚Äôve only recently been interested in my cultural clothing because of - well, internalized racism, which wasn‚Äôt great, LOL. But what I‚Äôve done is save up for custom √°o d√†i!  Traditionally, √°o d√†i is pretty eye-catching, especially in the U.S. (where I live). I‚Äôm saving up to create tailor-made √°o d√†i that‚Äôs more modern and something understated I could wear often: for example, switching out white silk pants for black ones, and the main dress for a crushed navy velvet. I find that modernizing cultural clothing can be a way to represent your cultural and ethnic roots without feeling strange or like an impostor, and seeing the same, familiar cuts in different prints and tones that I like fills me with a whole new type of joy.  I also follow other people who wear modernized cultural clothing. The first example that comes to mind is @asunnydisposish on Twitter, who is an artist but often posts pictures of her putfits (modernized hanbok). I have an album of Vietnamese clothing outside of √°o d√†i (like √°o nh·∫≠t b√¨nh) and other designers‚Äô takes on modern √°o d√†i, and another album of textures, prints, and fabrics I would kill to wear.   Other ways you can incorporate this into your clothing is supporting artists and designers from whatever ethnic group/culture you belong to!  If anyone‚Äôs interested in seeing the albums, I‚Äôm more than willing to share; I just don‚Äôt know how to operate imgur yet, which seems to be the go-to for everyone here. I hope this helped! Best of luck!
text:Those are good tips!  I've been looking at getting a custom qi pao myself (grandmother is chinese), but I've never had custom clothing. I guess there are always tailors around so I shouldn't worry too much about it!   I hadn't thought about local artists. I'll have to look it up. I meet so few laotian people outside of my family (as in never) that I hadn't considered reaching out or looking for them.   And yeah, I'd be happy to look at an album!	labels:	episode_done:True
text:WEEKLY DEALZ~	labels:I love buying secondhand, but I feel like shopping in person (at goodwill, etc.) is so  better than on Poshmark/Thredup/Ebay. I've missed finding deals during quarantine!

But, for example, I've wanted a London Fog trench for a while, and they're just... there. A bunch of options. Much cheaper than on most resale sites.

text:Reigning Champ - Construction Quality of Pima Jersey T Shirt vs. American Giant	labels:That's not fraying lol.  They're literally fuzzing up because of the extra long staple pima cotton.

Both are good quality but if you wanted the qualities of pima cotton, well, there you go. Plus "finer" quality fabrics are often worse in terms of durability.

text:How does a warm weather wardrobe differ from a cold weather wardrobe?	labels:I also live in Louisiana. You definitely want to have a pair of rain boots or waterproof shoes because of how much it rains in the spring and summer evenings. I have a pair of cute Chelsea boot style rain boots that are a lot easier to style. Also, get a pair of good quality sandals that are comfortable, I prefer Birkenstock‚Äôs.   I strictly wear shorts or mini skirts in the spring, summer, and most of fall, then jeans or leggings/joggers in the winter. I have denim shorts, chino shorts, and some cute dressy shorts, depending on the occasion.   I don‚Äôt really like dresses because it‚Äôs hard to find summer dresses that aren‚Äôt sleeveless, and I just prefer to have some kind of sleeve.   I personally would get too hot wearing a sweater in the spring/summer, and I am very cold natured, but I keep a lightweight jacket in my car in case I go somewhere and the AC is really cold. I am not really big on tank tops, so I just wear a lot of short sleeve tops. I don‚Äôt even rotate my tops because I will usually just wear the short sleeved ones under a jacket in the winter, and I only have like 3 sweaters anyway.   Also not big on hats, personally, and the only time I see other people wearing them are for photo shoots or going to the beach. However, I do recommend some nice sunglasses.

text:Anyone have a job that requires you to wear "work clothes" (nursing, trades, etc.)? What is your off-duty wardrobe like?	labels:Security here.   My non-work wardrobe is extensive and colourful and very 1950s.  I don't like wearing my security uniform into work unless it's freezing cold and I can hide it under a winter coat, because it's made by the same uniform supplier as our local PD.   So I end up wearing most of my clothes anyways, because I don't want to be mistaken for something I'm not.      Plus i've had incidents where people threaten to wait outside for me after I get off work (because I've kicked them out, or caught them stealing) and I've walked right by them and they have NO IDEA because I look so different in my regular clothes.   So it's a safety thing too.	episode_done:True
text:What will be obsolete by summer 2021?	labels:I'm hoping those "Is it Wine o'clock?" shirts (or anything involving  women drinking wine to deal with life) you find at any mall store/Target directed towards adults.   Perhaps it's because I can no longer pass as a youth and will no doubt get thrown into the demographic these companies sell to, but it's always painful when you start to see a trend in clothes and you hate it, and it lasts YEARS.

text:[Serious answers only] FAQ: Why does runway fashion looks like nothing you'd ordinarily wear on the daily?	labels:The best response I‚Äôve ever heard for this question was comparing runway high fashion to the concept cars you‚Äôll see at auto shows. Those cars will often never make it into production but that‚Äôs not the point. The point is to show off new materials, technologies, design philosophies or to generally stir up interest in a brand. Same for fashion.

text:Hand wash only clothes	labels:I have an excellent tip for this! Get a large salad spinner and some gentle lingerie soap, put your really delicate stuff in with some warm water and detergent, spin a hand-full of times and let it soak for 5 mins, drain the water out and fill it with cold water, let it soak for 5, then spin, drain, refill, spin drain repeat till it comes out clear. Takes maybe 15 mins total and you don't destroy your clothing. You can even spin it again once the water is out to speed up drying if you let it air dry.
text:I handwash all the time--the salad spinner is a great idea!  Most of the clothes that I handwash call for cold water only though, so I never use any warm water.  As for detergent, I use Woolite.  Threads are more delicate when wet, so I avoid any rough wringing--I roll them up in towels to get most of the water out.  With knit sweaters etc, I let them dry laying down, put back in their shape, as they get very heavy with water and hanging could cause them to lose their shape.  Since I already have many pieces that I handwash, I just end up doing that with all of the pieces I care about/really want to last and it works great albeit a bit time consuming!	labels:	episode_done:True

text:I second the Blundstones! I've had the #1351 Original High-Top Boots and the #584 Thermal Chelsea Boots, and I love them both. The #1351 have a slimmer ankle and are water-resistant. The #584 are completely water-proof and have a removable sheepskin footbed and are super warm. I wore them nearly every day last winter, and they still look new. They do take a bit of breaking in though, especially the #584 because the ankle is slim.	labels:	episode_done:True

And I don‚Äôt have to wear some uncomfortable CONTRAPTION to fool the world into thinking they do. I fully support women who feel their best in an underwire bra.

I think there are perfectly valid conversations to have about all the issues and considerations behind feminism, intersectionality, and how it relates to clothing.  At the same time, I'm seeing so many comments on this thread that assume the worst of OP's motives.  OP literally asked about alternatives to a company that she had found to be problematic.

I also bought a few clothing items that is taking forever to ship though. I might cancel some of them and wait out the rest.

text:General Discussion - October 27	labels:I think early MFA and the attendant blogosphere it spawned / belonged to / helped popularise is partially to blame for the whole "timeless" nonsense.  We've come a long way from "well dressed men wear suits" to "actually shirts and blazers can be dressed down" to "actually you can wear what you want and look good", and maybe the whole "timeless", "dapper", "classic", "gentleman" thing was a necessary part of the journey, but... would it just fucking die please.
text:There was a reddit shower thought awhile back about how Dads are like time capsules because they wear whatever was popular / in style when they had kids... as if they just stopped buying clothes and keeping up with trends once they had the first kid.  It seems like mid-20s/early-30s white guys in tech are the same. Based on what they're wearing, you can tell when they first started paying attention to how they dress. And they're all convinced that whatever they wear is timeless or classic, without recognizing that they just bought in to whatever was trending at that time (menswear, minimalism, streetwear, etc.) and that they already are starting to look dated.	labels:I dunno about this. I've been watching a lot of 70s-80s horror schlock and one thing has stuck out is how often people look normal, with the Cool People looking really out of time. It seems like around sometime in the early 80s, things just sort of...stuck and your average casual clothes haven't changed too much. If you go back to the 50s, people weren't really dressed like today, but 40 years ago it's all jeans and tees. Sure we erred on the side of slim when the Big Internet Fashion Boom of 2012 happened, but the fundamentals stick around and if all you do is buy 501s and the OCBD you get off the rack at whatever store is closest, you'll probably look Fine, which is what 90% of the people coming through here care about and also assume other people care about.	episode_done:True

text:Advanced Fit Pic Techniques	labels:- Focal Length: 50mm (on an APS-C sensor). That‚Äôs pretty long and I basically have my camera set up at the other end of the room.  - Aperture: Usually f/4.  - Lighting: midday at a north-facing window. Gives a very bright, blueish hue that brings out black clothes quite well imho.  - Background: just what I have in that corner of the room. The wall there happens to be painted in a metallic blue which might help with the lighting. I‚Äôd prefer white, but I‚Äôm not going to repaint for taking fitpics.  - Angle: I keep the lens pretty much at navel height. I think that gives the most neutral representation of the fit.  - Editing: The camera is sometimes having trouble computing the correct exposure for an all black fit (I have it on shutter priority because lazy). I usually play with the curves tool in post to get the textures right.  FWIW, my camera is an ancient Nikon D90. It still outperforms a modern smartphone, but it‚Äôs getting pretty close.	episode_done:True

text:My 10x10 Capsule wardrobe challenge results	labels:I‚Äôve never tried the challenge myself so it‚Äôs cool when others do and share their results.  I think outfit #9 works best because of the colours (green and white are dispersed well visually on top and bottom), the fabric weight matches for the top and bottom, and the contrast in size/busy-ness of the patterns.  I think #2 is my least favourite because it looks like you‚Äôre kinda divided into 3 harsh segments (black / blue / black). Maybe if you had something blue on top it could help integrate the outfit better? Like maybe a blue necklace or scarf or some other accessory with some blue.	episode_done:True
text:Somebody else loosing so much time to choose the right item to buy when looking for something? I feel it cost me more in time when I try to buy responsibly.	labels:Yup exactly. It's a combination of getting the item you want, made with the right ethics, and for the right price. I try for all three and manage about a third of the time (second hand item from an ethical producer that looks right and fits). For other things I give up on one, i.e. raincoat that fits the first two categories but is new and therefore ¬£¬£¬£, or underwear that doesn't fit great but is ethical and moderately priced.      On the plus side, in theory they'll last longer than an item made to a lower standard, so less time spent buying in the long run.     You don't need to be in love with the item for it to be the right one though. It's nice when that's the case, but for many things lowering the bar a bit to functional+ethical is probably more achievable.	episode_done:True
text:My Gucci Addiction: Vanity Fair editor Buzz Bissinger's essay about spending $638k on clothes	labels:The line in the piece that stuck out for me was when he said he was on medication for "mild bipolarity."  The out-of-control spending, the hypersexuality, the losing a job due to temper outbursts...I'm not a psychiatrist, I just play one on the internet, but all of that put together  sounds like, at the very least, untreated hypomania.  To pass it off as only shopping addiction or "discovering himself" seems like underplaying some serious mental illness.
text:Regular people have mental illness.  Rich people have *glamorous* mental illness	labels:Exactly. Regular people are hoarders. Rich people are ‚ú®eccentric
text:I‚Äôve seen people say this, but tbh hoarding is something completely different from eccentricity. Rich or not, if your living space is unsanitary because you have too much crap in your house or your spending addiction damages your life, then you‚Äôre a hoarder.  If you just have unconventional style or make whimsical choices (like carefully curating an unusual collection) then you‚Äôre eccentric.   These words have completely different definitions.	labels:Yeah, that was the idea of the joke. Maybe I‚Äôll use an /s next time.	episode_done:True
text:Shitpost Saturday: the Festival of Clothing	labels:Let me tell you the tale of my dad's jean jacket! My dad obviously bought this thing in the 70s, because it fits me and my dad has not been skinny since shortly after he got married lol. It sat around in my parent's closet till I was a teenager and it was trendy. It stayed at my parent's house when I graduated college and dumped stuff there while I moved to Germany and rejoined me when my parents got rid of their house. It has now followed me to our tiny house on the arctic circle because I figure an item of clothing that durable should stick around for what must be at least the third time it's been trendy! Along the way it even had afb elimination fight with a sad knockoff jean jacket from some mall brand that shrunk to half its size the first time it touched water in a washing machine üòÜ it will definitely still be here, and probably still be in style, at the end of the world lol	episode_done:True

text:What are people's experiences with clothing challenges like trying not to buy clothes for a year/only buying second hand? What are some tips?	labels:for me the biggest motivator for only buying second hand is the ethical aspect. just reminding myself each time i'm tempted to buy first hand that the industry behind the clothes is vile and i don't want to contribute to that. the environmental aspect is a plus.   as for not buying clothes at all, i can't help because i love fashion and i don't really have any interest in giving it up. i started shopping more frequently when i started buying second hand actually because i just love digging through piles and piles of clothes to find the perfect piece. it feels very rewarding	episode_done:True

text:Colour/Style Matching - How do I figure out the potential of my wardrobe?	labels:I'd suggest rotating your wardrobe.

I try not to wear the same things too often- after all I paid for those things sitting in the back of my wardrobe so I want to wear them lol	episode_done:True
text:Purses: Real vs. Faux Leather?	labels:I just want to throw out a couple of points for anyone considering the ethical standpoint of the two. The best thing you can do for the environment is always, always, *always*: buy fewer things, buy less often, buy secondhand if you can. To that end, real leather is generally better- it lasts so much longer, and will only look better with age. Even if a good fake leather bag lasts 10 years, it will start to crack and look a bit ratty after a while, while real lather can last easily five times as long without turning nasty (provided it's well cared-for).      Obviously if you draw a hard line about owning animal skin then that's a point worth bearing in mind too. And of course, both real and fake leather can be problematic in terms of exploited labourers and use of harmful materials in the production process. There are a lot of factors to consider.	episode_done:True

text:How do you guys who like a formal/business look manage to not look the same all the time?	labels:Is this an pressure that is coming internally from you being bored or more externally from perceived social pressure or media pressure around you? It sounds like you know what you like and that you‚Äôve already come up with outfits you love but feel pressure to be ‚Äúnew‚Äù. Reading about capsule wardrobes and minimalism may give you more justifications for repeating outfits that you love. If you are bored with your look, you could also try changing up your hair, make up, accessories and keep the outfits that make you feel powerful.
text:Wow that just made me think like actually. Just sat silently for a minute there. I‚Äôve kind of always been a serial outfit repeater my whole life and it‚Äôs always been pointed out to me, and now that i have no one looking at me to point it out, I feel that bore.

text:Shopping my own closet for the perfect tee	labels:I'm a big fan af this. Every time I clean out my closet, I find hidden treasures, but I also discover how much of it I really hate, or how much of it seems tired to me and sort of depressing.   I tend to only have items that I love the most in my closet, (I ideally strive for 14 days worth of wear) and then put 7 days worth of clothes some other place, that I don't exactly love or hate. Stuff you'd move furniture or do spring cleaning in. Sometimes I look at these clothes and decide that I missed this or that, but most of the time, it gets cycled out after a while and donated somewhere.   I live in a very small apartment, though, and I dislike the extra work that comes with too much clutter. A lot of people like to hold onto their clothes, because trends cycle so quickly and unexpectedly
text:That makes sense for a small living space - I think I‚Äôd want to cut down my wardrobe a ton for that too! Since I have more space, I like having a bunch of tees so I don‚Äôt have to worry about them getting worn so quickly (although again, maybe that means they don‚Äôt ever wear out before I get tired of them, so I should reconsider that!)	labels:	episode_done:True

Unfortunately this means no sandals during the summer unless I really think it's worth it to sacrifice cuteness for knee pain!
text:Along the same vibe I do Iron Rangers in the winter and white leather Nike's in the summer.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:How many clothes do you have? (Really?)	labels:I think the size of your wardrobe is going to depend on your climate, job, hobbies, and general lifestyle. I have a lot more clothing than that. I also live in a place with four seasons. I have outdoorsy hobbies that require some tougher clothes. I can‚Äòt wear my casual clothing to work (and I‚Äôm also holding onto some more professional clothing from a past job in case I return to that field). I don‚Äôt have a lot of disposable income either, so I always keep things like dress pants even though I never wear them in my everyday, because I can‚Äôt afford to go shopping when interviews and funerals come up.  For instance, I probably have at least 15 dresses alone, once you count all the strappy sundresses, nice work dresses, wool sweater dresses, the cocktail dresses, and the evening gown that‚Äôs in the back of my closet - and everything in between.  I swap out my clothing with the seasons and have one closet that I share with my husband, so I try to be judicious about what I keep, while giving myself grace that I don‚Äôt need to get rid of something just because I don‚Äôt wear it regularly.
text:I mostly try to use the same clothes across hobbies, though maybe I can get away with this because I don't need specific clothes for hobbies.   For me summer is super thin wool. Fall and spring I add on a lightweight wool or puffer jacket. Winter I wear both the puffer and wool jacket and a rain coat to block the wind. Though I am worried about having too many clothes, so I was very careful about being able to layer across seasons. Having one coat for each season would be the problem for me. Having multiple that I can layer and get use throughout the year is fine.   I have a little linen that can be added in here and there for purely aesthetical reasons, worn between the lightweight wool and warmth layers.  I also work in tech, so it is all t-shirts and jeans, so I'm usually the one who is "over" dressed. I pretty much only work, hike and lounge at home. So everything I do is "casual." I haven't been to even a business casual event in over 6 years. So yes, lifestyle definitely means I just don't need many clothes.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Is fast fashion really fast fashion if you get years of use out of the garments?	labels:Honestly, I feel like the best way to be sustainable is to just buy less. I try not to buy much and attempt to not buy from companies that seem particularly egregious, and I do thrift, but I‚Äôm also still paying off student loans and hardly raking in the cash.  Is it better to buy your one shirt every 3 years from a sustainable brand that treats its workers well? For sure! But I‚Äôm typing this my iPhone with a Macbook in front of me and to be honest, so are a lot of people that claim to only shop ethically. Do what you can, absolutely, but let‚Äôs not let perfect be the enemy of good.
text:Absolutely!! I do what I can, but mostly I just try to buy less because even cheap clothes are a huge portion of my income. If your budget is such that a $50 jacket is already a big purchase you're only doing every few years and a $900 jacket is impossible, it's ok to buy the cheap version and keep yourself warm.	labels:1000%! I have a parka from American Eagle that I got in high school (I graduated 11 years ago...) that I still wear every winter. Was it sustainably and ethically made? Likely not, but thanks to that $70 purchase I‚Äôve avoided buying who knows how many new coats.	episode_done:True

text:Can You Wear a T-Shirt Under a Blazer and Not Look Like an 1980s Leftover?	labels:This look working is dependent on a couple of things. The fit of the shirt and the jacket has to be on point. The fabric of the t-shirt should be higher-end cotton or similar material, can't be your run of the mill t-shirt. Most importantly though is the person wearing it, you've gotta be in shape to pull this look off or you look like a sloppy neckbeard.	episode_done:True

text:Is the high fashion industry a little tone-deaf for F/W 2020?	labels:Why would it be tonedeaf? This is kind of a U.S.-centric view. Not everyone in the world is still struggling with COVID, and a lot of the rest of the world isn't nearly as casual as America is, fashion-wise.   Call me crazy, but I'm tired of shapeless billowy clothing in earth tones, and I am READY for some structure and interesting textures. All summer has been about beige and washed out green and brown linen, let's see something else.   Plus, it's a weird take anyway, because high fashion doesn't really target loungewear, either way. Do we really expect major fashion houses to all abandon blazers and leather pants and start showing PJs and sweatpants on the runway?   Others have already pointed out that these collections have been designed months in advance, but consider another point - fashion has always been reactive. When forced to stay inside and only wear sweatpants for 6 months, people will rebel and start daydreaming and longing for the opposite. This pandemic was always going to inspire a sort of glam rock aesthetic, imo. BRING IT.
text:> All summer has been about beige and washed out green and brown linen, let's see something else.   I just bought a shapeless army green linen jacket last month, no lie. :D  I would love to see something else even if I'm in linen lounge mode personally.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:How do I figure out my "style"?	labels:I think start by looking at pictures online on Pinterest or Instagram of styles you find aesthetically pleasing and create a little dashboard with outfits that catch your eye. You can also think about some of your favourite actors or singers that wear outfits you like and try to save the pictures you find. After that i would go window-shopping online on websites that fit your budget and look around trying to find pieces similar to any outfits you saw. fyi; i would browse on a website first and then go to the actual store to try out what you saw online, it gives you an idea of what you‚Äôre looking for.  I think imitation is the easiest way to start finding your style. Once your comfortable in a type of style you can start experimenting with it and picking more personalized pieces. Good luck :)
text:I've tried that but feel like the outfits are too much for a casual stop at the grocery store. Any tips on that?	labels:I look for ways they can be made more casual by focusing on the silhouettes or components. My Pinterest is full of wool trousers, delicate gauzy blouses, full skirts, and chunky sweaters. I probably wouldn't wear an outfit with all of those components to the grocery store, but I might wear mom jeans with a pretty blouse and Keds, or a more casual skirt with a chunky sweater and some flat ankle boots, for example.

But in regards to dresses, I've had sleeves shortened, necklines lowered and raised, a LOT of dresses taken in, etc. When it comes to fabric, if the dress is made out of a cheap, or flimsy material, I'll only get it tailored if I think the fabric is worth it. So unless the 100% polyester was crafted well, I don't think it's worth trying to save the garment. My general rule of thumb is that if I believe that the tailoring will be more expensive than the total cost of the garment, then it's not worth getting it tailored/buying the garment. I'd rather save up to get a better garment than do what I believe is wasting my money.	episode_done:True
text:Does anyone have tips on how to find good stuff from Poshmark and other online thrift shopping platforms?	labels:eBay:  - Filter by fabric content. Try searching for wool, silk, cashmere, and other nice fabrics.  - There‚Äôs a filter for vintage that‚Äôs useful for finding unique items. Also make sure to look at sizes that you may think would be too big. Vintage clothing tends to run much smaller.  - Avoid stuff labeled as ‚Äúunbranded‚Äù its mostly just cheap junk mass produced in China that is heavily advertised on eBay  for some reason - Make use of the extensive filters eBay has, you can use them to find very specific items.    Poshmark:  - Sort by recently price dropped. This means the seller is really trying to get rid of the item and you can get a better price.  - Don‚Äôt be afraid to make an offer. I‚Äôve made offers I thought the seller would never accept, but they did and I got some great items for insane deals.  - Search by key words, the filters are not as good as eBay  - You can filter by your specific sizes, but I don‚Äôt recommend this on Poshmark. The system does not work well. For example, I put my dress sizes as 4 and 6, and they only show me dresses labeled those sizes while leaving out dresses labeled small or medium.   In general for online thrifting: - Ask the seller for measurements if they aren‚Äôt posted already, and compare to clothes you have that fit well.  - Filter by size, color, or brand to find more specific items.  - Create saved searches if there‚Äôs a specific thing you want that you can‚Äôt find
text:For Poshmark sizing, you can also select sizes small and medium. So I usually check the pant size (26/28) ‚Äúdress size‚Äù (2/4) and the regular size (s/m) to get all of the items in my size!	labels:	episode_done:True
text:I know ‚Äúfashion‚Äù but people of minorities are always forced to try better. Some Insights	labels:I'm Asian, not black, but this reminds me of something I've consciously learned to do in my career, to try to actively contradict stereotypes in order to encourage colleagues to actually engage with me as an individual with my own strengths, weaknesses, and personality. In the U.S., stereotypes aren't nearly as harmful for Asians as they are for black men, but in the workforce I've seen a lot of Asians plateau at the lower level, informal team lead positions, while getting stuck being hidden away when it comes time to build relationships or manage long-term, strategic goals.  I've played up my blue collar background in order to disarm the "nerd" stereotype, and I've played up my military background as necessary to remind people that I have management and leadership experience, and that I'm not just the guy hired to be some technical specialist, or the one-off task. It's also an easy way to connect with other vets.   Early in my white collar career, I retained my military haircut, maintained a stronger (rather than a leaner/cardio-friendly) build, because from what I've seen, a bit of a subconscious bias about blue collar = power lifter while white collar = weekend marathoner.  Now that I've climbed the ladder a bit I've been able to back off some, and adopt a bit more of the style and look of a mid-career white collar professional (but in a fashion-conscious way). I've also gotten older so I haven't hit my strength (or my cardio) goals in a while, and I look more like a white collar professional that way, too.   And maybe I'm overthinking things, but I found that leaning into meathead or combat vet stereotypes allowed me to avoid being pigeonholed like so many other Asians who came before me. So this linked study at least seems roughly analogous to what I had already seemingly experienced, albeit in a very different context with very different considerations.

text:Thoughts on ski / apres ski style?	labels:Skiing is a strenuous sport, often done in a dangerous alpine climate. I wear technical gear: bright loose waterproof jacket and pants for visibility and mobility, wicking warm base layers, balaclavas and goggles to protect my eyes and skin, a helmet, and a backpack or fanny pack with an emergency kit.   After skiing, I strip off the outer layers and walk around in uggs, tights, and turtleneck.   You know what? I 100% blend in. I don't look better or worse than the hundreds of other people who have just come down from the mountain. This is why people specifically wear bright colors. Your party will be able to identify you at a distance from the specific colors you're wearing.   I think ski/apres ski style is to skiing what cottage core is to farming/homesteading. It's an aesthetic for people who don't actually do it.   If you like the look and aren't interested in skiing, then look into some New England heritage preppy looks. The bean boots, scandi wool sweaters, thick stretchy stirrup pants, fluffy trimmed accessories, and parkas may appeal to you. Uniqlo has some cute stuff in their recent collab that has that cozy lux vibe. Moncler and Gorsuch are some OG European ski fashion wear companies. You could look into those for inspiration.   But definitely don't try to go skiing without a waterproof pant and jacket combo. You will have a terrible time, given how much you will likely fall. (Assuming that you're a beginner.)

text:Distinct Fashion Phases	labels:I‚Äôm 27. My style changed a lot when I was around your age, lots of fast fashion and forever 21 type stuff. Went from a hot topic emo in the mid 2000s to an ‚Äúindie‚Äù girl in high school. I was always overdressed at school which I enjoyed because I like to stand out.   Early college I had a little vintage pinup phase and would wear a full face of makeup with super coiffed curled hair. Later in college my style really started to solidify and has been the same since around 2015.   I like le cole des femme clothes a lot too!! I‚Äôd say my style now is a little bit school girl/uniform inspired, and the really typical ‚Äúfrench girl‚Äù jane birkin type stuff. I don‚Äôt buy fast fashion anymore and I‚Äôm finally in a place where I can get investment pieces and shop small. My typical outfit is maybe a pair of levi‚Äôs with some sort of thrifted blouse and mary jane heels, or a tennis skirt with tights and a sweater and loafers. I wear very light makeup now since my skin has cleared up in adulthood, even after wearing black cat eye liner for probably 15 years straight. It‚Äôs nice to look back and see how my style has stabilized and matured.
text:Seems like you have great style! Just looked Jane birkin up, I really like her style.	labels:she‚Äôs completely timeless, her style is so inspirational.
text:Wtf she's rocking thigh high boots with jeans in some pretty old looking photographs - way ahead of her time!

I'm not a fashion designer nor a trendsetter of any kind, and maybe this opinion is one of the reasons I'm not üòÇ I'm just not excited enough to reach for any of these pieces instead of something with a pop from some other brand.

text:Indoor layers	labels:I think what your serious outerwear is going to be depends on where you live. I live somewhere where the cute wool coats you may see in winter NYC or winter London are not practical. People where I live wear huge down feather coats in the winter, and we are definitely not wearing these coats inside. By extension, autumn is pretty brutal and people may break out their heavy jackets that are double-lined, but again, we‚Äôre not wearing these indoors. Since my area is super frigid, we‚Äôre not looking at outerwear trends to be cute. People who move here realize that they need multiple coats and jackets, and it‚Äôs to be practical and cover the variety of weather changes more than anything.  If I moved somewhere warmer, and didn‚Äôt need outerwear for the practicality reason, I would say that I actually love blazers and think they‚Äôre fine indoors (because you see blazers in corporate suiting, which is worn indoors). Your mileage may vary though, cause if somebody is wearing trenchcoats and leather jackets indoors, I would question if that individual is looking to leave the building.	episode_done:True
text:Shitpost Saturday: Fashion Resolutions	labels:Now that we're in week 579 of quarantine, I've forgotten what day of the week it is, which is... not great.

I also have resolved to only thrift my clothing, so I bought a used pack of day of the week underwear on ebay. It's missing Wednesday, but Wednesday is the worst day of the week anyway, so I'm just going to skip Wednesdays and go straight to Thursdays. Then, every two months, I'll have a leap week, where I don't wear any underwear at all, so that I can "reset" to the proper days of the week.   A flawless plan!

text:How often do you wash your clothes?	labels:I sniff test everything (except underwear, which is one wear/wash) and I just purchased a wool sweater for the first time and I was *so suspicious* of the care instructions telling me not to wash it lol. I scoured the whole internet looking for something to tell me that this information was fake and that my suspicions were correct. After an overwhelming amount of evidence telling me I would have wasted $100 if I don't listen to people smarter than me, I begrudgingly made a deal with myself to give airing out only a try and I would wash it if it so much as had a hint of a stink.  Four months later and the sweater is going strong! That'll show me. In hindsight it makes sense that wool is water and scent wicking, because sheep have it "on" all the time, it was just a big adjustment for me since I had never really had natural fiber clothes before.	episode_done:True

I gave up on the "every _____ under ____ should own ______" lists and just bought some slim-cut v-necks in colors that jive with my wardrobe. Instant layering capsule. I keep my graphic/memorabilia tees and my "nice" tees very separate, though; they're even stored in separate places in my closet because they fill such different functions for me. I'm not sure if I would take such a conscientious look at my t-shirt collection as you have here because  I mostly regard tees as either pajamas (graphic) or more akin to underwear (layering) than anything else. They're just functional - not something I love or cherish or feel the draw to be more intentionally mindful about. I just Respect the Stack.
text:Yessss! Shirt twins!  Tbh most of my tees are pajamas or layering tees as well (under hoodies/sweaters).

(Also for some reason my brain keeps going ITS ALMOST SUMMER GET READY even though... it‚Äôs not...)

I did way too much "fill the hole in your soul with stuff" this year, for obvious reasons, but I feel overburdened with the amount of clothing in my life now and I need to make a conscious effort to pare things down. If I run into a genuine need, I'll continue checking secondhand options first before buying new. I'll also continue logging outfits daily with Stylebook, because it helps me be honest with myself about what is and isn't getting worn in my closet (both for getting-rid-of purposes AND for informing-future-purchases purposes), *and* it'll help me focus in on what I gravitate toward in my day-to-day life rather than continually shopping for some nebulously just-out-of-reach fantasy self.   Summed up:  * Buy less, buy secondhand, buy practical, buy for TODAY (not a dream and a half from now), and buy only what is genuinely needed (very likely *nothing* for quite a while).  * Continue evaluating what I really need in my life, and how much, and adjust accordingly as time goes on with the goal of seriously paring down my closet to a manageable size.

text:Do you follow the conventional rules around "flattering your figure?"	labels:I guess I don't really follow them because as a pear shape the advice is usually to emphasize the other body parts to draw attention away from the hips. But I like my butt, so I don't feel like I need to specifically hide it.  Also I think bootcut or flare jeans that are usually recommended just make my legs look like columns, and slimmer pants actually show that  I have slim legs and ankles (which to me looks nicer). I think a lot of this advice was based on the idea that the goal is to look as skinny as possible, so if anything is sticking out it needs to be obscured. My mom said she never wore jeans in the 80s/90s because she thought her butt was too big for them, and it's not even a particularly huge butt. So at the time the hourglass ideal was just overshadowed by the need to not look "fat" it any way (especially in the 90s).
text:The 'make your legs look wider to counteract your hips' is indeed bullshit. All it accomplishes is....making my legs look wider. And yet it's parroted in every single advice for pears I've seen. If it is a holdover from the 90s like you said, that would make a lot more sense to me, as I'm always a little salty about the terminology that's involved that implies wide hips need to be hidden away and de-emphasized and are therefore ugly. When in reality, they're sexy and great.	labels:So much this! Very pear shaped and wearing wide leg pants makes me look way bigger on bottom, so instead of just my hips being big EVERYTHING looks big. Also the ‚Äú X makes you look taller‚Äù people used to suggest to me all the time, I‚Äôm 4‚Äô11‚Äù for god sakes no amount of pointy shoes are going to make me look tall!

I don‚Äôt know why I never looked up a tutorial or anything but the sewing would usually buy me 3-4 days until I could buy new ones.   Now that I‚Äôm more financially stable and I don‚Äôt have to wear black jeans to work, my pants tend to last a lot longer. When they wear out in the thighs/crotch I just toss them now.

East Coast/New England, so a good amount of exposure to rain, snow, etc.   I bought mine circa 2014/15 in Copenhagen. It's been my go-to for pretty much everything since then. Everyday commute stuff fits very easily. As OP describes, space is massive, yet the construction of the backpack allows you to cinch everything down to a pretty small (if tall) package. I've used it for 2-3 day conference trips. The open duffel compartment really fits a lot. The more structured "backpack" compartment has cushioned dividers, pockets, etc. for flatter or more delicate/smaller objects.  Frankly, I love it and its one of the most interesting and functional backpacks I've ever come across. And the design, which variously recalls elements of modernist architecture, is pretty distinctive. My best experience with it was when I fit an absolutely massive doorstopper of an exhibition catalogue (600+pgs, oversized art book, hardcover) into the duffel compartment and it just...swallowed it up.	episode_done:True
text:What do you like, fashion-wise, about loose-fitting clothing?	labels:A loose-fitting garment with the perfect drape does a lot of the same things a well-fitted garment does; it conceals what you don't want to see, enhances what you do want people to see, and leads their imagination to fill in the gaps with the best possible things.     My personal problem is that I've got a small, tidy waist paired with bulldozer hips and a substantial hip dip.  I find that wearing skirts that gain fullness just a few inches below the waist will help smooth out that hip dip so that all people see is that va-*voom* created by my waist-to-hip ratio.       I'm also a huge fan of knitted tops with batwing sleeves, since they almost never have any of the sleeve fitting problems that you often get in made-to-wear clothing, and that batwing... if it's  a cropped shirt, or it's tucked into a high-waisted skirt, trousers, or belt, creates a line pointing straight to my waist that I'm probably emphasizing anyway because it's my only good feature.     Also, gigantic, hideous sweaters.  Like just a huge pile of ugly with legs and a head poking out.  That is some real luxury right there.	episode_done:True
text:How do ya'll express your culture or traditional fashion in modern clothing?	labels:I'm from Kenya and when I was living abroad I would use accessories to express my culture eg jewelry, scarves etc. It's a nice easy way and let's other Kenyans know I'm one of them when we meet	episode_done:True

text:Does anyone invest in real jewelry?	labels:I'm Indian and gold jewelry is huge for us, so I have a lot of it that I've gotten over the years from family. When I got married everyone gifted a few pieces too.   I can't speak my native tongue fluently and I don't feel comfortable shopping in India, so online Indian jewelers have been a godsend. The styles aren't as trendy as the stuff you find in American stores but there are a lot of simple, everyday styles if you are willing to sort through the inventory. They ship directly from India (so longer shipping time) and are cheaper because Indians do gold pricing by weight and not design.  I used to not buy gold for myself because it always felt so frivolous...but a while ago I saw a comment on this sub by a woman who said she bought nice jewelry to celebrate life events/achievements and idk why, but it really stuck with me so I've started doing the same.

text:General Discussion - January 03, 2021	labels:Done a lot of thinking about my wardrobe and the amount of clothes I own and I think I‚Äôm gonna go through and pick a bunch of clothes to donate tonight.   I think it‚Äôs time I let the thrifting and g r a p h i c t e e life go for a bit. I own way too many band shirts and shit that I just don‚Äôt wear anymore. I need to suck it up and start investing in my wardrobe to get it to a place I want it to be instead of buying a ton of shitty bandaids for 8 bucks a pop at thrift stores. Time to be a big boy and learn to go for a few expensive pieces instead of a ton of cheap ones.   Wish me luck lads.
text:Good luck puma!  I'm at the same point with my wardrobe. I have all the basics covered and want to buy more cool shit, but cool shit is expensive. So I settle for shit that isn't as cool but still serves it's purpose, i.e. I have clark's wallabees instead of paraboots, uniqlo raws, and a lands end barn coat instead of a barbour. Of course I could just save up money to get the nicer shit that I really want, but that would mean copping less shit altogether which I was unwilling to do. Now I put myself on a jawn freeze to save up some money and practice some self control and patience.	labels:We‚Äôre in this together baybeeeeeeee	episode_done:True

I‚Äôm just not a jeans and T-shirt women. And that I‚Äôm not overdressed. A lot of people are underdressed.

text:How has your style changed as you‚Äôve gotten older?	labels:I've always been chubby growing up, and because of my insecurities I use to cover myself up from head to toe. Hair down, baggy shirt with long sleeves showing no chest, tall jeans with no holes, knee socks below the jeans, and a pair of old sneakers. I use to wear black a lot as well because it was slimming. I never owned dresses, shorts, tank tops, or sandals because I believed they were to revealing.  Nowadays, I am a lot more confident in my appearance. I partially contribute that to my weight loss, but my friends now also helped in boosting my confidence. I'm now able to wear jeans with holes in them, I still don't like sleeveless shirts, but am able to wear more fitted clothing and show some skin. I no longer wear knee high socks and sometimes just go out in sandals or some heels. I love playing with colors now and feel as if I'm on the path to finding a style which truly suits me. I also recently bought my first pair of shorts since I was a child, so that's exciting üòó	episode_done:True

text:Can you have a clothing style without actually wearing that certain style much?	labels:This isn‚Äôt a direct answer to your question, but I‚Äôve found I have a ‚Äòhopeful‚Äô sense of style and a ‚Äòrealistic‚Äô sense of style.  Hopeful-me will think about buying a teal floral wrap dress because it‚Äôs gorgeous. Realistic-me knows it will sit in my closet untouched for 3 years because I don‚Äôt wear teal!   I‚Äôve learned to differentiate between the two while I shop, at least. If I was a celebrity suddenly, maybe I would lean towards hopeful-me‚Äôs style, but for now I am normal and realistic!
text:Ooh I love this distinction. My realistic style these days is leggings and a tank top, maybe a scarf or cardigan if I have to turn my zoom camera on... but in my mind I‚Äôm still an avant-garde rave-goth faux gangster with impractical shoes!	labels:	episode_done:True

text:What clothing items have you reverted back to since WFH/quarantine?	labels:I've really been embracing dressing more youthful. I'm in my early/mid 20s, and now that I've worked a couple years at the same place, I'm wearing more what I want than boring professional. I also started caring about what I wear and planning my outfits. Velvet shoes, corduroy overalls, rainbow prints, sequins, bold colors. Who cares? I've been called out for dressing "fancy" before, but I've stopped giving a shit in correlation with my confidence in my abilities. I'm a teacher...if anything, I'm showing the students it's okay to be yourself and take risks.

text:Sewing your own clothes	labels:Whether it's worth it or not completely depends on what you personally value in your clothes.  Economy? If you just compare any shirt to any shirt, it's often not cheaper to sew it yourself. Fabric is expensive and if you use patterned fabric, you're going to have a lot of scrap pieces due to pattern matching (if that's a priority to you, it's often not a priority in cheaper fast fashion clothes).  Fit, style and comfort wise? If you get good enough at sewing, you can customize the fit of your clothes, choose the fabrics you like, and sew them in a way that you feel is comfortable, without itchy seams, bulk, tight shoulders, excess fabric pouting or whatever.  They're going to be perfect for your taste.  Quality compared to the price? Here sewing your own stuff will definitely be worth it. You can choose a good quality fabric, prewash the fabric to ensure a good fit even after washes, have a proper pattern that suits you perfectly, and then cut the pattern out of fabric that you've pattern and bias matched perfectly, which also means no further twisting after washing. Basically, clever and good pattern matching is going to take the garment from looking 20 bucks to 200 bucks.  There are many more factors to include, like time and labor and interest etc, but basically, if you like it, see it as a hobby that will provide you with clothes that most likely are going to last better than ready made clothes for the same amount of money.

text:Better With Age: 10 Things Better Bought Used ‚Äì Put This On	labels:Once again another insightful article and conversation from Derek.  Until fairly recently (the last 2-3) years, I didn't thrift or shop vintage much...aside from hitting up a surplus store on occasion. I also found myself wanting to break my own clothes in, for authenticity, but I'm loosening a bit on that.  My favourite second hand pieces are a pair of corduroys from Orvis, a vintage The Gap shetland sweater made in Scotland from the 80's and a nicely patina'd pair of paraboot chambord shoes. Oh and a deadstock French m47 field jacket. Actually might try a fit with all those...
text:How could you mention all these cool thrifts without providing any pics?	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What are your favorite, trusted clothing lines for buying wear-forever investment classics?	labels:For cashmere specifically, you should try Pringle of Scotland, Johnston of Elgin, and Agnona on resell sites. They are top tier cashmere brands but not " well known" like Brunello Cuccinelli or Loro Piana. Brora is also very good quality but their styles can be a little "JC Penny" or "Kohls‚Äù catalog. I don't know how you describe it, but yeah.  Otherwise, what immediately came to mind for me is Adam Lippes. It's insanely expensive, up there with your ‚Äúfashion house designers‚Äù but unlike those, it's not super well known and not an "it-brand" so there's not a lot of fakes floating around. I thrift it off of Ebay, the RealReal, and occasionally discount sites and never worry about authenticating it the way I would for say, Chanel, Dior, Gucci, Prada etc. I'm no stranger to designer goods but their material and construction is absolutely amazing. Like the highest quality, weightiest fabric you can imagine. Honestly you could wear their shirts inside out because the hems are finished so perfectly, it'd be hard to tell.   Another one that I love that I NEVER hear of is Petar Petrov. What that brand does with silk is frankly incredible. The colors and cuts (especially their very flattering body skimming bias cuts) are stunning in person and nothing like any kind other designer I‚Äôve ever seen. Again pricey pricey, but not popular/not high in demand so a diligent online shopper could thrift it more easily.  Sometimes even with truly luxury designer, I feel like the consumer is paying for the logo-bling, design and but necessarily quality. But these two luxury brands are IMO consistently both design and quality and no visible logos.
text:Johnston of Elgin is fantastic! I visited the factory while in Scotland and it was so fascinating to see how their goods are made. I got a few sweaters and a hat while there, and it‚Äôs been two years with very minor pilling (nothing a shaver couldn‚Äôt put right quickly) and lots of wear.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Can we talk sleepwear?	labels:I was very into this idea as well and invested in some Lunya PJs...but that elegant person I invisioned didn't magically appear. I still had a big messy bun, acne patches on my face and slept with my mouth wiiide open. I didn't feel as comfortable in those PJs and that fantasy I had didn't come true, ya know? I don't want to discourage you, just my two cents as someone who had a very similar thought process  I went back to tank tops and sweatpants and I find I appreciate them a lot more now. I make sure they fit properly and don't have stains or holes so I still feel reasonably put together.
text:THIS. I have been working on a lot of \~self improvement\~ this year and part of making my goals for 2021 has been distinguishing "the person I aspire to be" from "the person I am willing to be" from "the person I can afford to be."   I too have been on a journey to live a budget life of luxury especially when it comes to things like matching lingerie all the time and sleepwear and what I've realized is that I'm not actually interested in luxurious sleepwear. I'm actually interested in being the person that has two hours to unwind every night, takes a warm bath in a massive tub with a v expensive lush bath bomb, does a full face care routine, brushes her hair out, has little tinctures on her vanity to apply just a bit of perfume, puts on a silk gown, lights a candle, reads in bed, and turns out her lamp at a generous 9:30pm.   The truth is that the desire for the sleepwear is really a desire to have more silence, more time spent on me, and more time doing things that look and feel good simply because I like them and not because they serve any kind of real function.   I have moved away from using old t-shirts because I like the idea of dedicated sleepwear but I usually just go with a solid color cami / tank top / shirt and either some shorts or some sweat pants depending on how cold it is. They're cheaper but still look thoughtful.	labels:This is so beautifully articulated that it made feel things.	episode_done:True

I‚Äôm a winter-hater in CT, don‚Äôt enjoy being bundled up in piles of layers.  A cashmere sweater over a tank top usually does it, and a fleece or puffer vest over it for super cold days.     I know you‚Äôre on a budget, but it can be done!   Literally all of my cashmere is either thrifted or bought on clearance, so the max I would have paid for a sweater is around $35, with the low end around $12.

text:How do you dress in a casual work environment if you really enjoy fashion/dressing up?	labels:start off your job dressing in line with the majority of the company, especially when you go back in person. during that time, strengthen your in-person connections with your coworkers and make yourself as indispensable at your job as you can. you'll also get to observe how people *actually* dress in the office as opposed to having mostly people's zoom outfits and the HR dress code to go off of.   once you have that strong foundation from both a performance standpoint and a team dynamics standpoint, then over time start integrating your typical style into your work style. pay attention to people's reactions to it, both direct and indirect, and scale back or plunge ahead accordingly.   this worked well for me and my style is pretty off the wall. it took about a year for me to feel secure enough in my role and on my team to wear renditions of "my style" to work all the time, and then an additional year to make the more 'permanent' choice to color my hair (i chose to also check with HR before i did this!). i also personally find that the overall aesthetic is what's most important to me, so the "just wear bizcaz but with fun earrings and socks" sort of advice that many people exchange on ffa is not relevant	episode_done:True

text:Store closings at malls	labels:I pretty infrequently went to the mall, but stores closing retail locations really doesn't impact their online store much. It can, if the stores are fulfilling the orders, but most major brands should be adapted to online long before today and are able to fulfill orders. It impacts the business in that they're not getting the retail location revenue but they're already established online with processes and can usually just adapt. Unfortunately, brands with retail locations can't be like Amazon because Amazon's business is really hosting the retail of other brands with some of its own products, which means it has more resources and volume to make various returns, deliveries, etc. more efficient. It's not without its issues itself. Unfortunately, it's a hard time for retailers. :(	episode_done:True

text:TheRealReal x Gucci	labels:It‚Äôs not generous. $1 for items priced $300-$15000? They have a huge margin.   Also, the Real Real regularly puts the market price/retail price for goods higher than they actually are so that the goods are only a few dollars cheaper than new.   I‚Äôm sure people can find deals from time to time but I‚Äôm not a fan of the site.
text:I find TheRealReal useful for a few things - my Mary Katrantzou love has been well served! - but they selling things like Outdoor Voices for literally the same as retail AND you'd have to pay their shipping costs which would exceed how much it costs to get it from OV.  Def only useful for *very* specific things.   If I use them, I try to only go for designers not super popular for replicas because they've consistently been lax about checking for authenticity and if I want better replicas I might as well go on Taobao or WeChat.	labels:I‚Äôve gotten some amazing deals - but it depends what you‚Äôre looking for.

text:Does anyone else have this style issue?	labels:It took me quite a bit of time and money to realise that there are some styles I like looking at but do not suit me - either my body type or my personality, or both.  The hardest to let go of was the sort of floaty, drapey, effortless boho style. I wanted to waft around the place like a modern Romantic whilst gardening and being all artsy and shit. But my shape is basically round with hints of hourglass, my personality is not best suited to wafting anywhere (I bounce, mostly), and show me mud or art supplies and I will be covered in them before I've actually got near them. And any skirt that's made of light enough material to drape and waft elegantly, or goes below my knees, is going to be ripped to shreds within a day. So yeah - I admire those looks on other people and have discovered a style I like, that's practical for me and reflects my personality a bit.	episode_done:True

text:Why Did Bottega Veneta Delete Its Social Media Accounts?	labels:All these thinkpieces serve to do is mystify a transparent marketing strategy dovetailing neatly with the ethos of the brand. As a brand Bottega Veneta is fashion's equivalent of your friends on social media who announce to the world that they're going to be moving in silence from now on  ‚Äì a brand for those who want to be lowkey, *but not really*.  Social media makes sense for brands like LV for whom the core ethos is in your face flaunting, as Instagram is both chief flex medium and ultimate marketing tool to an aspirational public. Bottega Veneta's courtship is a bit different. If I'm BV I don't even want to be seen as attempting to court that customer, and so the retreat from social media makes sense considering the brand's appeal to aspirational customers who want to be perceived as more sophisticated than those of LV. In reality BV is every bit as accessible before (just type it into the search bar) but it's the *illusion* of withdrawal which is key, both in attracting more aspirational customers and retaining your seasonal clients, for whom discretion ‚Äì especially in LVMH's major growth market of China ‚Äì is key.  I don't have any experience in marketing or the luxury sector but what this tells me is that LVMH believes either that a social media presence was a waste of resources or that this'll help cultivate a fake sense of "in the know" among their growth demographic, particularly with COVID exposing the full extent of income inequality's social rot.  Considering influencer fraud, flexing, and the danger of being mixed in with the bland minimal luxury aesthetic running rampant on IG, it makes perfect sense for them to pull back.  &#x200B;  TL;DR: It's just good marketing. The brand will still be very present in all the relevant outlets that actually generate sales.
text:Bottega Veneta is owned by Kering but yeah the same thing still applies to them too.  I noticed that right after Phoebe Philo left Celine and that brand changed the whole look with Hedi Slimane, there was influencers on social media etc calling BV the 'new Celine' and hyping the brand, it was getting pushed on places like GQ and other mags too. Maybe that was an organic shift and the Phoebe Philo Celine fans just wanted a new brand to love after she left but also, it could easily be inside marketing from BV and Kering to take advantage of that space. And I remember Celine never used to have an Instagram page, social media or much of an online presence at all that kept it kind of mysterious, now BV is trying that. More than a coincidence?	labels:Good correction. Mixed it up as I was lasered in on the LV comparison.  Agreed. Between BV, The Row, recast Jil, Peter Do, even Lemaire in a way, seems to be a bunch of brands that've been competing for that post-Celine mantle. Could be them trying to speak quietly loudest, yeah.	episode_done:True
text:Lower quality items during Nordstrom Anniversary Sale?	labels:I make clothing and sell it.

text:Cyberpunk and Fashion | A Video Essay | 40 Minutes	labels:Great video and i am myself a fan of the Cyberpunk genre.  However i think that because of all the raised environmental awareness i don‚Äôt believe synthetic fabrics have any future but rather organic fabrics such as a cottons or wool etc.
text:I think synthetic fabrics are definitely here to stay and evolve tbh. They‚Äôre engrained in general fashion because of its military heritage. But, I notice some techwear fits overlook a lot of good organic fabrics. They‚Äôre classics that work for certain climates just as good as synthetics, or tech clothes. Well made Wool clothing is the best, and has great properties. Wool is a very technical material that‚Äôs been used for a LONG time. Cotton is alright for hot days, it‚Äôs major disadvantages are how much water it absorbs, and in really cold environments it‚Äôs dangerous if wet, or when sweating.	labels:Yes synthetics are here to stay for sure and i can totally see the military wearing uniforms made out of cheaper materials etc...  But synthetic fabrics havn‚Äôt been around for that long and it has already caused major environmental pollutions. It had it‚Äôs break through in the 1960‚Äôs so in this short amount of time it has caused a disaster already. Every time we laundry polyester or synthetics micro fibres releases and polluting our ocean water, so the fish get it in them which we eventually get back in our bodies again when we consume fish for example.   So even if it‚Äôs here to stay i‚Äôm longing for it to be taxed to the degree where it is not profitable to produce it anymore.   And absolutely yes! Wool is defenetily the best way to go. It keeps you warm as it releases steam from the body which keeps the wearer in a better state. While synthetic clothes on the other hand causes a ‚Äùthermos‚Äù effect which forces the wearer to compensate with more laundrying and tons of parfume because of all the sweating.   Cottons is for sure not as good but it still ‚Äùbreathes‚Äù in a way that synthetics doesn‚Äôt and can be made in many different ways depending on which season. Brushed to turn it into cozy flannel or corduroy for colder climate or denim or percale for warm weather.   My overall feeling tells me that we will move towards buying more consiously and less clothes of higher quality (since synthetics will be taxed too high anyway) in the future but to take better care of what we bought and therefore the trends will slow down a bit and leave people less anxious to feel constantly outdated and forced to buy the latest all the time. Which is ridiculus when you think about it.	episode_done:True
text:What ultimate-splurge fashion item would you buy to reward yourself for achieving a big milestone?	labels:I usually buy solid gold jewelry. Something timeless that will last forever and I'll wear forever. My most recent purchase was a pair of simple 45mm 14k gold hoops.
text:Why 14k vs 22k?	labels:Some reasons could be:   Gold is a soft metal. 22k gold will become damaged easier. Usually more important factor for rings that are worn everyday. In some countries, jewelry is made 14 or 10k gold. Some people prefer the color of 14k to 22k. The color difference is the other metals added to the jewelry.	episode_done:True
text:what are your fashion flaws?	labels:I simultaneously buy things I like regardless of having the occasion to wear them and also have a tendency to "save the good stuff" for these nonexistent occasions, which has resulted in a practical overabundance of clothes that are just a little too dressy for my lifestyle, and that this year I have literally had no reason whatsoever to touch...  I also don't know if it's just me but I'm constantly hooking parts of my clothing (belt loops esp) on cabinet handles?

text:Reigning Champ Hoodie: 2 months later	labels:Often times, cheaper, more utilitarian fabrics are more durable. While I can't speak to RC's quality as I have never owned any of their stuff, terry-cloth is generally a softer material and can be more likely to abrade. So if you are like me and place a lot of weight on your elbows while seated at a chair with armrests (esp if you have pointy elbows), then you might find that you develop holes there and so you either change up how you sit or you realize that you need something that will work with your use-case (denser weave material or maybe reinforced elbows/elbow patches). Not dissimilar to how some people put holes in socks more easily than others. Shape of your body and how you do normal, everyday things can impact how things wear on you.    More expensive does not mean more durable. These are not the same thing and it's something that people really need to stop using as a reason to spend more on something. Durability \*can\* be a high-quality product's claim to fame, but is certainly not generalized to everything.    Durability is also not a measure of quality. It can be part of why you consider something to be "quality", but that's up to you what you want from your garments. Unfortunately, you don't know what you don't know, and going by what people recommend means that you're basing your purchasing decisions on other people's preferences. Fashion can be an expensive hobby and there is a lot of trial and error as you learn about yourself and about the various things that go into making a garment.	episode_done:True

text:Winter jackets that are good for skiing and casual use?	labels:Dont go crazy on a jacket.  The key for skiing is layers and you can get a lot of layers that work well in other settings.   A decent base layer:  you can go merino or if you are on a budget milsurp poly pro.  A fleece over that.  Next layer is a beefier jacket.  Right now I have a half zip Patagonia that is poly insulated.  Then get a waterproof(ish) layer.  You have a lot of options but I usually run with a marmot precip.  It's cheap, has pit zips and folds up way smaller than a hard shell. That combo will cover you skiing 90%of the time and let you adjust depending o N conditions. Flexibility is the key.  Take the money you save and get some good socks and gloves/mittens and some type of balaclava.  No one ever came off of the mountain because their chest was cold but it was their hands/feet/face.

text:What are your favorite, trusted clothing lines for buying wear-forever investment classics?	labels:For cashmere specifically, you should try Pringle of Scotland, Johnston of Elgin, and Agnona on resell sites. They are top tier cashmere brands but not " well known" like Brunello Cuccinelli or Loro Piana. Brora is also very good quality but their styles can be a little "JC Penny" or "Kohls‚Äù catalog. I don't know how you describe it, but yeah.  Otherwise, what immediately came to mind for me is Adam Lippes. It's insanely expensive, up there with your ‚Äúfashion house designers‚Äù but unlike those, it's not super well known and not an "it-brand" so there's not a lot of fakes floating around. I thrift it off of Ebay, the RealReal, and occasionally discount sites and never worry about authenticating it the way I would for say, Chanel, Dior, Gucci, Prada etc. I'm no stranger to designer goods but their material and construction is absolutely amazing. Like the highest quality, weightiest fabric you can imagine. Honestly you could wear their shirts inside out because the hems are finished so perfectly, it'd be hard to tell.   Another one that I love that I NEVER hear of is Petar Petrov. What that brand does with silk is frankly incredible. The colors and cuts (especially their very flattering body skimming bias cuts) are stunning in person and nothing like any kind other designer I‚Äôve ever seen. Again pricey pricey, but not popular/not high in demand so a diligent online shopper could thrift it more easily.  Sometimes even with truly luxury designer, I feel like the consumer is paying for the logo-bling, design and but necessarily quality. But these two luxury brands are IMO consistently both design and quality and no visible logos.

My guess is that maybe a size up and then taken it at the waist would be better, but hard to tell for sure.  I don't think they are doing any more for you than the jeans you currently wear.

If you feel disconnected, try reframing your perspective and look for people, communities, and designers that draw you in and connect you.

text:Tips for reducing impulse buying/careless spending?	labels:I think buying *nothing* except bills and groceries might be a little unrealistic, given that you've slipped up a few times. Can you give yourself a small budget? Personally, I have a yearly budget for clothing. Some months I spend nothing, some months I spend more, but it's all bugeted for.  Overspending on clothes can come from treating shopping as a hobby. I switched from browsing online stores to looking at high fashion photo shoots and shows. Still scratches the fashion itch. But you can't exactly impulse buy a $10,000 dress.   Can you also try focusing on other, non-fashion related hobbies? Reading is a great one for me, and I don't spend anything on it because my local libraries are awesome.	episode_done:True

text:FAQ: When shopping on a budget, what items have the highest point at which they reach diminishing returns?	labels:I thrift quite a bit and take items to my local alterations tailor. Think vintage made in USA items made using natural fabrics (cotton, wool, cashmere). Sometimes they are made with older, odd, or boxy fits that are slightly off. Which leads me to the diminishing returns of...   Tailoring and Alterations (in relation to fit): These costs can add up quickly - and sometimes the end result will not be satisfactory.  Simple alterations like taking in the waist or sleeves usually work out - but major surgery with jacket shoulders and major pant adjustments usually are not worth the effort.    It's ok to pass on a sale or leave an item on the rack if you know the fit or alterations won't work out for you. On the other hand, it can be worth the extra $ to purchase something if it fits very well off-the-rack.	episode_done:True

text:Wish we could just ban people for this shit  Any conversation around "you have to be attractive/tall/skinny to pull this off", when taken to its logical conclusion, is just people saying that people that don't fit Western beauty standards look objectively bad *at all times* regardless of what they're wearing or doing  Like I've seen people say that if you're short or if you're overweight you can't wear "x", but the "x" is basically everything, and they never seem to reach the point where they admit that they just think that the best certain people can hope for is inoffensive or unnoticeable, which disgusts me	labels:And when there is a good reason, there is normally a way to word it to cover more, e.g. don't wear slim fit shirts if you have a beer belly > make sure your shirt isn't too slim around the waist so that you can comfortably sit down
text:Honestly that kinda ties into it too. If someone's asking "I want to minimize the appearance of my belly, how should I do that?", then that's definitely valid advice, but plenty of people would say "if you have a belly, just never wear any slim fit shirts", which is absurd - it's presuming that people's default stance *should* be hiding their body if it doesn't conform to certain standards	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - November 18, 2020	labels:Men's equivalent to Yoga pants. Hear me out. I wear a uniform all day 5+ days a week. I tend to work out in the morning (0445 ish). But when I get home, I still have stuff to do (take the kid to the park/play, go to the store, chores, etc...), so I can‚Äôt just slip on pajamas and call it a day (as much as I'd like to).  So, I‚Äôm looking to find out the men‚Äôs equivalent to yoga pants... that is, active wear that I can chase after the kiddo, and/or run to the store and not look like a total schlub... and maybe get my ass checked out periodically, lol.  If it helps, most weekends, I‚Äôm in jeans and a button down, maybe hiking pants and a technical shirt.  Thanks!

text:What Did You Recently Get Rid of From Your Closet (and How, Please Help Me Help Myself)	labels:I once got the tip to put everything in your closet with the open part of your hanger hook facing out. Then, when you wear something, turn that hanger the right side out (i.e. round side of the hook facing out). Set a time period that you want to revisit cleaning your closet (i.e. a season/year etc) and after that time period donate or throw out everything that still has the hook turned in. Similarly, pack all the things you aren't sure if you want to keep into a box and set a time frame. If you find yourself wanting to wear something in that box, take it out. At the end of the time-frame, donate what's still there (especially if you forgot that item existed).  Recently due to COVID, I moved across back the country so I had to fit my closet into suitcases. That involved donating a lot of things that are perfectly nice and wearable but what I had to admit to myself that 1)I actually never wore in the 3 years I lived there and 2) didn't miss in the few months that I was living without them (I was living out of a carry on when I got unexpectedly stuck back home).  In terms of the never throw anything out, perhaps donate it to  a charity that's helps dress the less fortunate for work? They're definitely pieces that others will love.

text:How to find the confidence to wear clothes you like?	labels:Confidence usually comes as a result of doing things. Part of this is trying new things and facing the fact that you might make mistakes; and that's okay, because it's a learning experience. It is not a crime to buy something and realise later it's not for you. Everyone does it.   Some people don't like the idea of making mistakes, so they try and protect themselves and the people they love from them. Sounds like your mother is like that. But at the end of the day, your clothes are for you to wear and wash. Her opinion is just an opinion. The only way you'll know is by wearing the clothes, washing the clothes and seeing how YOU feel about it.	episode_done:True

text:Negative Self-Talk re: Fashion Choices	labels:I don't think there's anything wrong with preferring dresses and leggings and it doesn't inherently signify that you are somehow unworthy for pants or "letting yourself go".   The thing is, historically speaking, dresses were actually far more practical for a woman's body due the cyclical changes we all experience, from menstrual bloating/cramping, to minor weight fluctuations, to pregnancy and breastfeeding (historically there wasn't much choice about the last two but obviously now there is), cuz you could cinch up or let out your dress depending on how you were doing.   It's only now that stretchy fabric is truly mainstream that pants have truly become as practical and cost effective in that they can tolerate a lot more cyclical size changes, which are *normal*.  Edit: not to mention all the times people would gain and lose weight due to the availability of food.   I'd say I have a pretty confident mindset and 90% of my non work wardrobe is dresses and skirts/shirt combos. I wear undersummers in the spring and summer, leggings and sweater tights in the winter and I've gotten SO MUCH MORE USE out of my dresses... They lasted me up until my 8th month of pregnancy, I barely had to buy maternity clothes.  I have been able to wear the same knit dress/leggings combo at 180lbs prepregnancy and later at 210 lbs post partum and still look cute.  What pair of pants could pull that off? Almost none, I tell you.  Saved me a lot of $$$.   No matter what I weigh, I always have a bit of a belly, so most pants dig into that anyways, which isn't comfortable. Only truly high waisted stuff feels ok, but I don't want to wear that in the summer.   It sounds like disordered thinking is creeping up on you, and you may have to consciously remind yourself that there's nothing wrong with enjoying comfy clothes that don't restrict your abdomen.

text:What are some habits that keep clothes/shoes new vs that habits that ruin them?	labels:Give shoes a day break between wearings.  A shoe repair guy said that even with socks, shoes absorb a lot of moisture from our feet. He suggested going  at least day on day off with shoes to give them time to dry and regain their shape. Otherwise he said they stay in that moist, malleable state and get out of shape more quickly.  Anecdotally I‚Äôve seen a major difference in the lifespan of my shoes.

I love shawl collar cardigans but i'm very sensitive to itchy wool, which makes it very difficult to find them. would you happen to know of any decent/higher end ones constructed in alternative materials?
text:I think the most obvious alternative - albeit $$$ - would be cashmere. There's quite a few options that have the same basic rib design as OP's wool version. I think the challenge with cashmere is that if what you want is a super-chunky look, your options become more limited since cashmere tends to be finer and thus the sweaters don't always have the same heft. That said, if you're willing to invest in a 4-ply or higher cashmere SCC, you might be able to attain that nice chunky look.   Personally, when I'm working from home, I have a knockabout 2-ply cashmere SCC that I'll wear when I just want a warm layer; it's really nothing special and doesn't look anywhere as substantial as my Northern Watters-made lambswool SCC but it's kind of perfect for a home sweater.   The other common option would be cotton or linen or blends of both but then you lose out on warmth/insulation. That said, I had a cotton SCC for years that was a go-to "lemme just throw on a layer" option in temperate months.   Do you have the same reaction to merino?	labels:	episode_done:True

text:I want to eliminate the need for dry cleaning my work wardrobe. Sadly, anything nice seems incompatible with machine wash. What long lasting, work pieces have been easiest for you to maintain?	labels:I WFH permanently now, but when I worked in an office I wasn't able to escape dry-clean-only clothing; there are some things that just need to be dry cleaned. However, I used Dryel to great effect (awesome for things that aren't stained or stinky and don't really need to be pressed). I will also say, many many clothing items that say "dry clean only" can be washed either by hand, or in the machine on a delicate setting with wool wash or other gentle low-suds detergent. (My dry cleaner, of all people, actually advised me to start washing my cashmere sweaters rather than bringing them in for cleaning - she said dry cleaning dries out and breaks down the fibers and washing them at home would help them last longer. I am still wearing my cashmere sweaters and so far, she's been correct.) If something is very structured or has an acetate lining I never try to wash it, but I have washed other things that were poly blends or wool blends and were marked "dry clean only," and as long as you hang them up to dry, it works fine.
text:>many many clothing items that say "dry clean only" can be washed either by hand, or in the machine on a delicate setting with wool wash or other gentle low-suds detergent.  I agree a lot of things can be washed at home! Heck, I've even thrown dry clean only items into the washer + air dry because I'm cheap and bought the garment cheap and wanted to see the outcome. I wash my woolens in a sink with woolite, and put them in the washer on spin to remove the water. I recently hand washed a suit jacket with no negative repercussions, it could use a bit of a steam on the shoulders, but otherwise A-OK.  The only thing I worry about is silk, of which I own very little.

I would recommend 1) Buying it all there, because they'll have what's good for their climate and 2) starting out with cheaper options (thrifted, Old Navy, Target range) even if it's not quite your style. Don't spend much time, effort, and money until you see how you really feel after at least a year of seasons. Maybe you want warmer stuff than you thought you would, or realize you should invest in nicer socks, or discover you don't actually like turtlenecks, or shift to a different style when you're surrounded by a new area's vibe. Let yourself experience it for a bit without pressuring yourself to do it all right.

I find a real leather bag is more sustainable as well since you wouldn't need to repurchase it again soon compared to the faux leather which would not hold up as well over time and thus you would need to repurchase over and over.	episode_done:True

Found a photo book on the Kennedy‚Äôs and thought Jackie looked pretty chic on the boat so she talked our friend group into renting a boat for the afternoon. Three of us knew how to sail - she did not. The thing to remember about sailing is it‚Äôs dirty (especially rental boats) and boats kill clothes (chafe, catching on sharp bits.

First was when I moved from a trendy college town to a trailer on a ranch (lol, I f***ing hated it). So all my cute shit went bye bye and I basically only had clothes I could feed pigs and cows in.

I work in healthcare and live in a politically mixed area, and everyone is automatically friendly to me.   Con: People assume I'm straight. So if I mention my fianc√©e people assume she's male, and if her pronouns come up I have to have this whole awkward interaction where (at best) they go "Oh--she??? Ohhhhh" and then look me up and down, awkwardly change the subject or ask me invasive questions, and stop being so friendly with me. Also, men hit on me, and women never hit on me.

text:What age did you start pinning down your style? And how many times has it changed since then?	labels:I had a school uniform til 17 and truly wore the most random clothing until I was done university. I never thought of the clothes I owned as a whole, and instead just picked up whatever piece of clothing caught my little magpie eye.   When I was about 23 I started looking at my clothes a bit more strategically in terms of ‚Äúoutfits‚Äù rather than ‚Äúitems‚Äù as in, if I want to have these cool funky pants then maybe I need to have a simple black shirt to go with it. When I started I definitely got sucked into the ‚Äúessentials in every wardrobe‚Äù lists but in the last two years (since I was 24!!) or so I have learned stopped using those as a template for my own closet.   It also helped that I became a bit more confident in myself ‚Äî I used to just want to blend in and be unnoticed and that showed in my wardrobe, but now I am happy to be wearing something a little more out there. I have always loved the ripped jeans, all black, big stompy boots look, but where I grew up was so not a big stompy boots country that you couldn‚Äôt even find items like that back in my day. Now that I‚Äôm older I‚Äôm more confident in wearing those kinds of items.    Since that is my main style I don‚Äôt vary too much from it, but I have been enjoying working on little ‚Äúmini capsules‚Äù of items that are a style I like to delve into occasionally, such as a cowboy/cottagey look or just looking like a disco ball. I have a very narrow colour palette of 3 colours so  as long as my mini capsule items are the same three colours I can wear them head to toe for eg a full cottagey look, or I can just wear my peasant blouse and black jeans to tone it down. :)	episode_done:True
text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - December 26, 2020	labels:Anyone have any recommendations for warm sweaters that aren't wool or any type of fur? I've looked through the different wiki threads, but am having trouble finding anything without wool that looks like it would be warm. No budget limit, thanks for any help y'all can provide.	episode_done:True
text:Sizing relationships between brands	labels:Great advice so far, another thing to take into consideration is fabric type. For example pants in a cotton and spandex blend are going to be more forgiving, fit-wise, than 100% cotton. So for example I could wear skinny jeans in size 30 if they had spandex/elastene in the fabric, where the same brand and size in 100% cotton denim might not get past my hips.	episode_done:True
text:Bags that are actually beautiful - what are you loving?	labels:I‚Äôm also a fan of understated but elegant handbags. I bought a pre-loved Celine nano luggage that I have been loving. I enjoy Mulberry‚Äôs designs too and will probably get my next bag from there as their bags are relatively affordable compared to some of the bigger designer names. I love Chloe bags too but I think those might be a little too trendy and blingy for me.  Totally agree with you on Bottega, I think it‚Äôs overrated, especially the dumpling looking bags.
text:I was also considering getting the Mulberry Alexa (which I wanted back in the day), but it reads a little too cutesy to me, and in general Mulberry I associate with upper middle class 40+ Londoner, though I think their designs are really beautiful.   Agree with you on Chloe designs being nice but too trendy/iconic, I swear when I was younger there were so many nice bag designs (celine luggage, alexander wang cylinder satchel, proenza schouler etc.). I just can't with the boxy BV bags either or any bags that look like a hard square...  Feel like these bags are going to be out before they are in. Heavy branding on YSL bags has already cheapened their look to me. Love Cos/Madewell bags but the colour selection is boring (just black/tan). Meh! I ended up going for Jil Sander Tootie in a pale grey/green, hoping it gives me that 'sparks joy' feeling irl :D	labels:	episode_done:True
text:If you could get yourself one fashion gift, what would it be?	labels:I‚Äôd probably identify the most worn 2 pieces of my work wardrobe and upgrade them to something really nice - or something like really well made, tailored suit separates that can be worn on their own or together for a great suit.	episode_done:True

I transitioned to thrifting and focused on ‚Äúvintage‚Äù aka <2020 clothes in natural fibers to find my style. Now I feel like I can recognize quality clothes, which cured me of any desire to shop crappy fast fashion. Now if only I could break my thrifting addiction...that would be the last step on the road to a small, high quality wardrobe.	episode_done:True
text:Do you have a concept of "Par Value" in menswear?	labels:I don‚Äôt have a lot to add, but I do like what you‚Äôre saying here. I think that my way of buying is the same idea, just less formula and more general in approach. I never take the time to compare, but I‚Äôm aware of enough brands and price range to have as a guide.   I know a few people mentioned like spend your money as you please, wear what you like, and I get that on SOME level.

The top two are an Alexander McQueen silk skull print scarf and a Mulberry Alexa bag.

I think the trajectory for counter culture folk is almost always: counter culture -> normal core -> reincorporate elements once more secure in life because its not aphasemom.	episode_done:True

text:Does anyone else use a ‚Äúformula‚Äù to create their outfits?	labels:As a maximalist, I just mix whatever colours, textures and patterns resonate with me. I don't love super strict rules about how many colours we should wear or whatever. More is more and fashion should be fun and have a sense of humour. I especially like making references to particular vibes (e.g. Latin American drug lords with colourful print shirts and gold chains, but really exaggerate it and make it more fashion-y).  Obviously, not everyone feels the same way. You do you.	episode_done:True
text:Anyone else feeling incredibly disconnected from the 'fashion world'?	labels:I feel the opposite, right feel like almost every ‚Äúoutfit‚Äù I see influencers in nowadays is just jeans and t-shirt. If they weren‚Äôt hot and young, the same outfit would get dragged. Like mom jeans and a giant tucked t-shirt that looks like it came from Walmart and we‚Äôre raving about Bella Hadid‚Äôs style. I find it very hard to find fashion influences for adult women that aren‚Äôt super basic, skewed super young, or just generic preppy ‚Äúput a blazer over it!‚Äù J-crew style. The only place I see any creativity at all is in super high end fashion, but that‚Äôs not within the reach of most of us. The whole fashion industry in general is skewed so young, it‚Äôs like after 30 they think I should just wear a sack. The only reason the super high end brands cater to an older demographic at all is that older wealthy women are the only ones that buy their clothes. Any price point below that is plain plain basic city

Not for personal styling but for makeup I‚Äôve slid into the DM‚Äôs of a couple makeup artists for online lessons, game changing.
text:Ooohh thanks for sharing! I actually rarely go clothes shopping with my friends so I'll try it out more	labels:Ask someone for a zoom hour of going through what you have and recs.  The more specific you can be about your preferences and limitations (for me I don‚Äôt do dry cleaning or heels over 1.5) the better your results will be, pro‚Äôs and the online services have a form you go through but what I really like asking a friend is the bonding experience and cute compliments, people are always flattered when you tell them that you admire their style.

text:How would you describe the quality of self-knit/self-made clothes vs. store bought?	labels:a home sewer/ knitter, who is relatively experienced or at least willing to put in the time to do a good job can 100% meet or exceed the quality of store bought clothes. It's just a matter of using techniques and good quality materials. If I sew something quickly and don't finish my seams, it might not hold out as long as if I take my time and am careful and thorough with the finishing methods on the inside, then it will almost certainly be better quality and more sturdy than something from H&M, for example.	episode_done:True

text:What did you teach your mom about fashion?	labels:How to mix and match pieces. My mom finds a combination that works (often because it is the store display) and just does that. She'll "mix it up" by buying the exact same thing in several different colors, but she will still pair them with the same item. So, like red shirt and blue pants and the same shirt and pant but in green and brown, but wearing the blue pants and green top would probably not occur to her. Which is very uniform and fine, but she was complaining about how she has two closets of clothes and looks the same all the time...the first time I took a skirt and paired it with a different shirt than the one she always pairs it with, it was like she thought I was a magician. She also still has some matching-print tops and bottoms from the late 80s/early 90s and breaking the pair up (like, wearing the patterned skirt with a solid top) made them look fresh and new...But she is also the type of person who doesn't ever rearrange furniture on her own and rarely tries new recipes either. She just is good with sticking with things that she knows will do well enough.    But yeah. Shopping her own closet for new combinations was a lightbulb moment for her. (My grandmother is the same way. She literally hangs her outfits on the same hanger, so *those* pants go with *that* sweater, which is how she ended up with, no joke, 47 pairs of white pants at one point üò¨)	episode_done:True

text:General Discussion - December 23, 2020	labels:Not to bring up the cape thread again, but something really has been stuck in my craw. It was some comment about how people who basically wear cowboy shit are ‚Äúattention seekers.‚Äù This was very clearly framed as a bad thing. Western wear aside, I feel like the subtext of the comment was basically ‚Äúif you‚Äôre not wearing something to fit in, you‚Äôre seeking attention.‚Äù Isn‚Äôt the pursuit of dressing better/more fashionably inherently attention seeking? And why is that a bad thing? I don‚Äôt understand what seems to be the lurker notion of ‚Äúwanting to dress better to blend in better.‚Äù If wearing the shit I wear labels me as an ‚Äúattention seeker,‚Äù then I‚Äôll wear that badge proudly.   Sorry for the rant, this really just got under my skin
text:Lurker concept of dressing better is dressing ‚Äúgood‚Äù in a mainstream sense. Something that is restrained without being flashy. Something that other guys will say ‚Äúcool jacket!‚Äù But won‚Äôt be scary to wear.   It‚Äôs how the basic Bastard came around. Inoffensive but still good.   It‚Äôs hard to talk to my friend who clearly wants to dress better and cooler but just can‚Äôt. He loves all the stuff I wear cause it‚Äôs cool and preppy (he‚Äôs also New England born and bred) but he‚Äôs in the more jock/frat category than I am (engineering nerd/artsy) and I think the idea of stepping too far out of line will be met with ridicule. I don‚Äôt really notice that stuff cause I‚Äôve been doing it for so long, but for him even a new jacket or sneakers is really stretching it and he‚Äôs hesitant to step away from normal guy stuff.	labels:Yeah, I think I fall into the trap of dressing like this for so long that it‚Äôs sorta second nature at this point. So what is out of the norm for some people feels comfortable for me. I understand the fear of stepping away from the norm, and also understand that‚Äôs where most lurkers are. But I don‚Äôt understand the mindset of different=always bad. Idk maybe it just boils down to simply wanting to fit in

text:+J/UNIQLO SPECIAL COLLABORATION: What‚Äôs the verdict?	labels:the outerwear is all spectacular and i think much nicer quality than regular uniqlo outerwear.  i thought the sweaters were a bit thin, which was slightly disappointing.  all the cotton items are pretty standard uniqlo cotton (maybe slightly smoother) but the cuts were fun. the silk items felt nice, but not as nice as more expensive silks (obviously). the silk knit shirts were less soft than the bow blouse but i think that's just the nature of knit silks?  the wool items were all fab. i got trousers and the skirt and love them both.  also EVERYTHING WAS SO BIG? i know some of the items were supposed to be oversized but the sizing wasn't consistent. i was my usual size in skirt/pants and sweaters/shirts, but i had to size down in the oversized items because they were too big. the hybrid down coat which i got in a M (my usual uniqlo outerwear size) fit like a L or XL. the cotton shirtdress which i also got in a M (for non-outerwear i am usually between a s/m in uniqlo sizing because i am tall, and generally go with a M for sleeve length) fits like a L, but for that one i can make it work by styling it differently. if they had it in a S i would have gotten that instead, tho.  generally i am pleased with what i got. i think for the price it's not bad, and i like the cuts of the pieces and higher than usual fabric quality, although some pieces felt more worth it than others.   i do NOT think it is worth buying at a markup tho. none of the pieces were particularly unique (except maybe some of the outerwear) and you would be able to find similar pieces from other places at a similar price point i think.
text:Thanks for that very thorough summary. How did you manage to snag so many pieces???	labels:i live in NYC and i popped in to the soho flagship last sunday!  they were sold out of most of the popular items (no silk bow blouse, and xs-m sizes of most outerwear and blazers) but i managed to snag a few of the last size M pieces i had missed out on online. (i only managed to get the hybrid down coat online)
text:Nice work! I hopped online last week (maybe Wednesday or Thursday) and found almost everything sold out. Unfortunately I didn‚Äôt have time to make it to a store over the weekend. I suspect I‚Äôm out of luck. My online haul included shirts and the dress and some sweaters but I suspect the best stuff, the outerwear, is what I really missed out on.	labels:i checked the website at 9:30 the day of the release and most things in size xs-m were already sold out in the more desirable colors (black/white). before the announcement email even went out!!  i think i just got lucky because i checked on a whim after logging in for work.   only some stores were carrying the line irl. if you live near a flagship they might still have some things!	episode_done:True
text:Future of fibers?	labels:You might be interested in the following books:  Fashionopolis The Future of Fashion   If I recall correctly both cover new types of textiles.	episode_done:True
text:Future of fibers?	labels:Personally I don‚Äôt find it very difficult or expensive to shop for clothing made with natural fibers ‚Äî if anything it‚Äôs gotten even easier to do so with online shopping and websites showing fiber content right in the product description. I don‚Äôt have to seek out brands that specialize in natural materials either ‚Äî my clothing is mostly from Madewell, which doesn‚Äôt really market itself as being all that environmentally conscious or sustainable, and is definitely not a high end brand, but they have tons of options for clothing made of cotton, silk, etc.   I will say it‚Äôs gotten harder to find sweaters made of 100% wool over the years, however. I have several wool sweaters from mall brands that I bought just a few years ago. I gained some weight since then and have been looking for replacements from the same exact brands and it seems like they don‚Äôt even bother with 100% wool anymore, all of their sweaters are now made with acrylic, nylon, polyester, etc. That‚Äôs the only natural fiber that I feel has all but disappeared from the mainstream for some reason.   I will also add that I don‚Äôt think man made fibers are necessarily ‚Äúcheap‚Äù, either. We‚Äôve come a long way from man made materials of the 80s and 90s. When I think of man made fibers of today, I think of technical clothing and gear such as outdoor or sportswear. Patagonia for example is the poster child for environmentally friendly brands, but most of their clothing is made from man made materials, and their products are far from cheap. Partly because it performs better for its purpose, and partly because it‚Äôs supposed last a lifetime.  Which leads me to my last thought ‚Äî IMO man made materials aren‚Äôt necessarily bad for the environment. It‚Äôs really our habits that are bad, and the industries that cater to these habits. If we all bought a few items of clothing that were all man made and lasted our lifetime, that is arguably *more* environmentally friendly than if we were constantly buying and throwing away natural fibered clothing.
text:This is the point I came to make, IDK how people are having difficulty finding natural fibers, my entire wardrobe is 100% cotton and linen and I shop at like, Zara and H&M lmao.   Most jeans are sturdy 100% cotton these days, it's easy to find cotton t-shirts, cotton knits and stuff like that...I guess silk is the only one I haven't really seen, but even wool pops up here and there even though, I agree, it's harder to find.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Grad/Masters Fashion Program Reality?	labels:Are you actually getting two bachelors by double majoring?  If so then stay the course and finish your degrees. Two bachelors will give you options in both fields and certainly make you a better candidate for a job. If not, then I‚Äôd consider taking the two year hit to do what you really want, I didn‚Äôt do that and spent my 20s flopping around in different fields.  Best of luck to you!
text:Yes, I‚Äôd be getting 2 bachelors!  it‚Äôd be a lot of work, but I would have both marketing and fashion design. I think it‚Äôs a smart move to get both.  It was Covid at the time when I had to make a transfer decision and it just felt weird starting 4 years all over again. especially while being online. I only have 3 semesters left and thought double majoring then going to grad would be a good compromise.   But I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôd just be too late by then.	labels:I would stay the course and get two. I‚Äôm in my masters now for a field I should‚Äôve been in a decade ago
text:So you think putting my head down for 1.5 years and getting the Marketing and Fashion Bachelors. Then move onto a grad/MA in fashion design would be more with it?	labels:Oh yes certainly, although I would talk to your advisors and see if grad school is even necessary. I worked in digital marketing (not fashion) with a BS in Psychology and no one cared about masters at my agency.  I started my masters this summer and in two weeks I‚Äôll be over the halfway mark to graduation. A year is nothing and a year and a half is a little more than nothing ;) You‚Äôre still so young, I really wouldn‚Äôt worry about it!
text:Interesting, I‚Äôm just worried that my current school won‚Äôt give me enough to go right in to fashion being that they‚Äôre a California State school.   I was hoping a masters or even associates from a my focused fashion college could really solidify my skills.	labels:Oh I see, well definitely talk to your academic advisor before deciding on your own to invest in another degree, they can help you make an informed decision.

This winter I decided fuck it, I wanna look a little nicer at work so I have been wearing clothes that are a bit nicer for me and making sure I always have an apron over them. Otherwise I just have a lot of stuff that will rarely get used. Before covid I loved dressing nicer to go out to dinner or a brewery or even to a friends, but now when I‚Äôm not at work I mostly wear sweats and leggings.

text:The last time I came here before moving here I saw a man covered in his own shit continuing to shit while shivering under a blanket   That was the moment where I really knew I wanted to live here	labels:Honestly, my favourite NYC Subway moment was a week after I had learned how not to make eye contact with *anyone*. A fat white man with a portable speaker on his chest walked in. He wore a baseball cap that said "JESUS!" and a hoodie that said "THE LORD".  He spoke up. With a confident voice he announced to the cart, "I am not poor or destitute, I have food and shelter, praise Jesus. I do not need and will not ask for your money. I just love to come on the subway and rap for the Lord." At this point I'm thinking "oh this is going to be *amazing*". But I had learned not to make eye contact, so I kept my eyes on my phone and my headphones in my ear. I did turn off the music though.  Indeed, he proceeded to turn on his boombox. A simple beat started playing. The fat white man tapped his foot for a few seconds and, once he got into the rhythm, he began to rap for the Lord. His voice was a bit feeble, but the meter and rhyme scheme of his verses held up. He clearly was experienced, as he came to a natural stopping point just a second shy of the next stop. There, he disembarked and disappeared.  This is probably a more or less regular occurrence for someone who lives there, but I had that warm and fuzzy "omg this is exactly like I always imagined" feeling. It was very hard to avoid looking at him, which I'm sure he would have mistaken as an invitation to talk to me. Everyone around me seemed *entirely* unfazed.

text:Experience with fast fashion brands for office casual clothes (Shein, Fashion Nova, etc)?	labels:I would not recommend Shein. I see a lot of their clothes in thrift stores and I see why‚Äîthe quality is really low, fabric is really thin. Plus it‚Äôll take a long time to ship.   H&M is a great option for cheaper workwear pieces. Have you thought about using Poshmark or ThredUP?
text:Thank you for the advice! I think I'll go for H&M.  I'm based in a smaller european country where buying secondhand isn't really a thing but I'm gonna give it a chance anyway, it's possible things have changed since the last time I looked!	labels:i'm sure you cn find a good online platform for used clothes! maybe buy better quality, a little cheaper...	episode_done:True

text:Tips on how to master the style of HBO‚Äôs Succession?	labels:I would stick with the classics of the European heritage brands as inspiration if that Old Europe look is what you're going for. Trench coats/Macs (APC has a beige Mac this season that's decent price, Mackintosh, Burberry etc for inspiration), fine Merino wool sweaters (John Smedley makes great turtlenecks), classic tees and sweats that fit well and don't lose shape after wash (Sunspel is a good brand) and tailored trousers (this can range from Incotex, Paul Smith to some independent tailors you can find in Asia such as Yeossal, Craftsman Co. for cheaper alternatives). For shoes, I would pick well made brands like Solovair (they make the unbranded version of Doc Marten's Made in UK stuff) or Kleman's (Made in France shoes).  Main thing is that these clothes look expensive even while being simple is because they are expensive. It is not easy to go to Topman, H&M or even a Club Monaco/J. Crew to replicate that look.	episode_done:True

Has anyone else had such experiences with this kind of shoe or other Bottega products? I had to get it returned because my retailer was out of my size entirely, and my next option is SSENSE, which is significantly more expensive.

It's been terrible for a long time. * Have the athleisure stuff, but also focus on high quality basics, again with less SKUs. Have something like an "essentials" line. The Navy Suit. The Charcoal Suit. The OCDB. The Chino. The Wool Trouser. Without fifty million variations thereof. You go now and it's like here are three navy suits with different kinds of stretch, here are four more with some kind of temperature controlling fabric. Just give me a half to full canvas lined 100% wool navy suit in various fits and sizes. In other words, simplify your menswear line to cut down on SKUs, and that will give you more room to play with sheep on skis and stuff (i think that does sound kind of cute, very Ralph Lauren). * Do away with Golden Fleece, Red Fleece.

At least from my perspective in North America.    I don‚Äôt know if it will last forever but probably at least the first half of this decade.
text:Doctor here. Even in the hospital athleisure wear is now standard. Used to be a mix of scrubs and professional among the doctors.

text:Sorry you feel that way. When I wrote it, I tried to convey that I didn't put much thought into what I wore. Perhaps I could have said pajama bottoms with RRL cardigans. I don't have a perfect description for it, but I do think that the style Andrew is wearing there is a lot more coherent. I think there are ways to do that style thoughtfully, and not randomly.

Have to agree with others that the pebbled olive is not an appealing colour. The black and the honey one on their website are not bad.
text:You think so? I like olive shoes cause they contrast with a lot of the lighter colors. It all depends on the style I guess.  I got the Feits on sale so they were pretty good. Might review them eventually.	labels:Just my own preference on colours. A forest green would look a lot nicer (in suede?).   Would also love to get a review of Feit too!

Like, it would make sense to me if it was Ivy, but everything is black or grayscale instead of navy and "tan-scale", but when several of the top posts of all time feature people dressed in a cream sweater and golden brown corduroys or an orange sweater with tan pants, it doesn't really distinguish itself aside from the props in the background of the photo.	labels:>I don't really get that sub's aesthetic.

text:For the parents of girls	labels:I have three kids, one girl, one boy and one trans-boy (13, 10, 15) who still dresses fairly feminine. My kids have always been allowed to pick their own clothes and style them how they want. Sometimes I give them advice on their fashion choices which they are free to ignore. They love my style and frequently steal stuff from my closet.  We don't have a lot of body type discussions in regards to clothes, because I don't want that to be their focus. I want them to focus on creativity and enjoyment of their clothes. Plus for my trans kid, their hourglass figure is a stressor for them. If they are struggling to style something, I help them out.	episode_done:True

text:How do you feel the Pandemic is affecting your style? (Or, ‚ÄúI am a butterfly in a chrysalis‚Äù)	labels:I‚Äôve been working at a grocery store throughout Covid so most days I wear jeans and a store tshirt. It‚Äôs too cold to even dress up for fun at home so practically all of my clothing goes unworn. I totally am feeling the chrysalis thing right now though! I‚Äôm losing weight (retail workout/anxiety diet) and my taste is getting really forest gothy. I don‚Äôt have time or energy to sew right now but I have dyed a lot of my fancy fabrics black and hung them all up. I love seeing all the tonal and texture variations. I‚Äôm going to use some of my historical patterns from a range of periods. Maybe wearing fabulous clothes after Covid will help us heal from this awful period.	episode_done:True

text:Dressing for ‚Äúhousework‚Äù vs ‚Äúworking from my house‚Äù	labels:I've been a SAHM for 12 years now, and I learned early on that it was easiest for me to get up each morning like I was going to work, shower, and get ready for the day (do my hair and makeup). That means I'm prepared in case of an emergency or something unplanned. My uniform is jeans and a "cute" top. Right now, my kids are doing virtual learning, so I'm running around helping them, plus fixing their lunches and snacks, in addition to my normal chores and errands.   My favorite shoes are Gabor loafers, which I have in several colors. And I just purchased a pair of Dansko Nora loafers. They are super comfortable, lightweight, and have great support. I typically go barefoot at home (which is why my Bombas wear out), but I walk my dog every day and these are great for that.  I really love having a uniform, and I have several pairs of the same style jeans, and multiple tees in different colors and styles. If I have to leave, I can throw on jewelry, grab my bag, and I'm ready to go. I was a teacher previously, and having a system works for me at home. Huge hugs to all the moms doing double duty right now!	episode_done:True
text:What are your coziest winter finds/essentials?	labels:Ugh slippers!  I gave in and got a pair and I can't believe I let 14-year-old me influence 31-year-old me's purchases.   I also got two sweatsuit onesies from Old Navy and they're pretty fantastic. The only problem with them is that I'm between sizes so a SM looks great once it's on, but it's kind of a struggle and a MD is easy to put on but is baggy in a way that I can't really leave the house in	episode_done:True
text:Bruce Boyer on Finding Your Wardrobe and Sustainability in Fashion ‚Äì Put This On (Derek Guy )	labels:i wish articles like this avoided the "expensive clothes sustainability" trope. the systems that lead to people being able to drop several thousand on a suit are inherently not sustainable, and i would love to see more discussion like that in the last question where consumption itself is addressed. imo the answer will involve more people taking responsibility for the origin of their own clothing with a focus on local labor and materials

text:When will I be "too old" to look cute, cool, hip, whatever?	labels:You're overthinking it.  Be comfortable in what you wear and you're always in the right.  The judgements of people that think you look 'too old, cute, cool' etc are, fundamentally, a trap to be stepped over and disregarded.  Those people are a roadblock to true happiness and self-actualization, every single time you see one of them their only function is to stand between you and a good time, telling you about their compiled list of reasons for why this or that thing shouldn't be how *YOU* want it but how *THEY* want it.  No thanks, I'll pass on listening to those voices, and so should you!	episode_done:True

text:Noel Fielding X Fendi menswear colab	labels:I see Noel Fielding. I remember the Great British Bake Off. I updoot.  When I think of Fendi, I'm not a fan due to the overt branding on the baguettes. I don't think this collection really strikes me as interesting, though I am a fan of look 31 and the blue piping detail. The graphics also don't excite me a ton, except for the cursive Fendi coat in 23 (and I actually love the pop of the turtleneck and gloves and piping - so whimsical!) This collection confuses me as it's simultaneously very muted but also funky, but I don't feel as though there's cohesive messaging. I don't know Noel from anything besides GBBO, but I would have expected or liked a l'il more goth and/or more color out of the collab.	episode_done:True

text:Red Fleece is fantastic and distinctly different from the main line. Skews younger and has better cut of jackets in my opinion. Most of their main line suits are padded, lined, and boxy. They‚Äôre good but the overall result is pretty conservative, even with lighter fabrics and fits. It‚Äôs good stuff off the rack for sure, just not terribly flattering.

text:Synthetics in Our Wardrobe	labels:Depends on the synthetic for me - like OP said if it serves a purpose, I love them. I think there's also a huge spectrum of quality with synthetics that can either make it unbelievably comfy or a scratchy heat trap from hell (although tbf you run into the same thing with wool).  What does creep me out is you would not want to be caught in any type of fire related emergency while wearing the majority of fast fashion synthetics because they will melt into your skin and make burns worse.   I also avoid polyester as a hard rule always but thats because it gives me the worse BO and I smelled like chopped onions all day.
text:>What does creep me out is you would not want to be caught in any type of fire related emergency while wearing the majority of fast fashion synthetics because they will melt into your skin and make burns worse.

text:Are jean shorts on men really that bad?	labels:I‚Äôve seen them cycle in and out of style a couple times in my life. Like a lot of things, when they‚Äôre on-trend it‚Äôs relatively easier to style them, when they‚Äôre not it‚Äôs a higher degree of difficulty. To a lot of Americans they summon up associations with certain groups of unfashionable men (like stereotypes of hicks or rednecks), gay men (esp. if they‚Äôre short), and/or are a punch line (ala Tobias F√ºnke). Undercurrents of classism and homophobia in some of that, unfortunately. So when you wear them, some of the reaction you‚Äôll get will depend on how you play either against or into all that. Which you may or may not care about.	episode_done:True

text:Where did I say it was easy? I know that building class consciousness and labor organizing takes years, if not decades or more. But I didn‚Äôt know what this strangers life was like, so I just made a recommendation that if they can, they should try and unionize.   I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll be able to unionize my workplace but I‚Äôm planning it out with 2 coworkers I trust right now. Every little step matters.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:What are your thoughts on outfit repeating multiple days in a row?	labels:I think the pressure is to not be "strange/unaware of your appearance" or more likely not to look "poor/can't afford more clothes." Some people do notice, and the rude ones point it out. This perception starts young. Growing up, there were teachers and other school staff who repeated outfits and other children loudly pointed it out.  I repeat outfits as much as possible if I'm not seeing the same people (my household doesn't count). The internal pressure is strong to not repeat within a few weeks of seeing the same people to avoid potential comments.
text:Ah yes, strategizing when you wear which outfits because you want to wear an outfit multiple times but don't want to risk being seen wearing it twice. I loved the first two years of college for that reason- M/W an T/TR classes had entirely different sets up people. The outfit repeats were abundant.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Dressing larger bodies - without looking sloppy	labels:I‚Äôd add that the most *important* fit for these clothes are the shoulders. Whatever top you choose, the drape will be affected by what is primarily holding the weight of the fabric. You could experiment with different fits in your shoulders and see what flattering drapes occur on your body.
text:You know, I've noticed that too. Great tip!	labels:	episode_done:True
text:How do I figure out my "style"?	labels:I think start by looking at pictures online on Pinterest or Instagram of styles you find aesthetically pleasing and create a little dashboard with outfits that catch your eye. You can also think about some of your favourite actors or singers that wear outfits you like and try to save the pictures you find. After that i would go window-shopping online on websites that fit your budget and look around trying to find pieces similar to any outfits you saw. fyi; i would browse on a website first and then go to the actual store to try out what you saw online, it gives you an idea of what you‚Äôre looking for.  I think imitation is the easiest way to start finding your style. Once your comfortable in a type of style you can start experimenting with it and picking more personalized pieces. Good luck :)
text:I've tried that but feel like the outfits are too much for a casual stop at the grocery store. Any tips on that?	labels:Part of it is accepting that it's okay to dress up for the everyday. You do everyday stuff every day so why would you exclude those things from opportunities to feel like your best self?   Now is, I think, a perfect time to play around with atypical/"special"/non-casual pieces in every day wear. There's been a great blurring of lines between occaisions and I'm seeing lots of real business wear matched with casual items, like pencil skirts with chuck taylors or dress pants and denim jackets. Ultimately, it is the full package more so than indivdiual pieces that make an outfit appropriate for a situation. That isn't to say that there aren't specific items that are inherently inappropriate for some settings, but that at least some of the partitions we've placed between items of clothing are unnecessary and arbitrary, and they prevent creative engagement with your closet.	episode_done:True

text:Learning about technical side of clothes - fabrics, care, quality etc.	labels:I think a lot of people here that say their clothing falls apart quickly aren't properly caring for their clothes.

I recommend everyone learn how to properly launder their clothing.

text:FAQ: What are the different use cases of boat shoes, moccasins, driving shoes, and loafers?	labels:For me, the simplest distintiction would look at it in terms of the casual vs. formal.  Obvious with the name, boat shoes and driving shoes were originally designed for people who wanted stability/comfort when operating a boat or vehicle. But nowadays, boat shoes, moccasins, driving shoes are all meant for casual outfits when you don't want to wear sneakers. They can be worn with tees and jeans, casual button downs, chinos etc for just a regular night out or weekend errands.  Loafers on the other hand, have a large variety (ie. penny loafers, horsebit loafers, chunky lug sole loafers that are trendy right now, unlined Belgian loafers, etc) that they can go from casual to formal. I would even argue that velvet slippers that people match with tuxedos would fall into the loafers category too. The popular look this summer had been pairing Weejun loafers with Patagonia baggies for a more casual look but the loafers on the higher-end price points (Gucci loafers, John Lobb, Baudoin and Lange, etc) can easily be paired with suits and tuxedos.
text:To add on:  The formality of a loafer is (generally) determined by a few things:  Leather: Smooth leathers in darker colors are more formal. This is opposed to leathers with a visible grain, or with a nap (suede).   Stitching: If the stitching color contrasts with the leather, it's more casual.   Outsole: Lower profile, darker midsole with a dark welt finishing is more formal. A formal loafer will also have a raised heel, a flat heel is casual.   Styles: The more plain and sleek, the more formal. Beefrolls, bits, tassels, heel pinches, and other such flourishes are *generally* less formal. However this is sometimes a point of debate, and most people won't care or notice.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Why It's Important to have a Style POV & Desired Aesthetic	labels:I only skimmed this (I do enjoy reading your posts, just on a lunch break and today's a long day) but I can totally get so much of it. It's only been recently that I've really gotten what I want to look like, and it really is great to not feel tied down by what "works" in a traditional sense. Sometimes there are more meh days and such but the fun for me has been getting to the look that I want to see myself in, and it has really helped me feel more confident and not like I'm just wearing a costume. Though that isn't to say my days arent frequently pretty basic, but even then there's always a piece in an outfit that I wanted there to be, whether it's a specific shirt that I like the pattern, or how a specific bracelet goes with my colors.  Though I will add something, I do find it quite frustrating when someone asks me for advice. Not because I don't like helping people with clothes (I quite love it sometimes), but because a lot of these people don't know what they want to look like and while I *can* dress them it's not really *them*.
text:Thanks for perusing, haha! I'm glad that you're getting closer to your own POV and acting on it. That intentionality is really what makes it seem less like a costume *and* makes mistakes easier to swallow.    I totally get you on the basic days- even I have my lazy stuff, but it could be white socks + loafers or a bucket hat that makes it my outfit more interesting and special lol.

text:Changing Your Habits: Deciding to Not Shop Brands for Ethical or Other Reasons & Following Through	labels:Growing up in a small town and then moving to a bigger one, fast fashion was a whole magical thing to me. After a few years I learned more about how terrible it is and shopped there less, but that's hard to do when you're poor. I discovered thrift shopping and have been addicted to it ever since, although I realize I'm privileged in that I'm easily able to find my size at any thrift shop. Now I'm a little less poor, but still unable to afford local fashion so I keep thrifting. I support local designers when I can by going to their sample/warehouse sales and recommending them to others.   I find the hardest part to be shopping for basics. When I need a plain black tank, I go to Target because I know exactly what I'm getting.	episode_done:True

text:Spend $250 on a good replica bag or Tory Burch?	labels:I have a few designer bags, but I bought them heavily discounted. I went through a PHASE and bought a bunch of bags, and now I'm done. I also regret spending thousands on waxed canvas??  I have a friend who fucks with reps and she's always concerned that someone will call her out for owning fakes. I wouldn't be able to deal with that constant stress, even if the bag were a really good knock off and I got a great deal (compared to retail) on it. I also think that the whole "they aren't QCing the bag, they're QCing you" is really fucking rude.  If I buy more bags, I wouldn't buy designer and stick to okay quality and mid-tier prices. There's nothing wrong with indulging if it's going to bring you joy, but I think that a lot of people drop $$$$ on a bag and then never  fully enjoy it because they're afraid of scuffing the leather.
text:Waxed canvas, lol. Yup. I got tons of that.  Worrying about people being able to tell you have a fake and being self conscious about it is not worth it.	labels:The self-consciousness wasn't worth it to me, either. I decided I was better off going quality no-name, since the brands I could afford were not doing anything I liked. One day I'll have the money for even a used name that I'm interested in, but for now I'll support a smaller operation.	episode_done:True
text:What true heirloom pieces do you own and how do you incorporate them into your style?	labels:A little different but I own several saris and a couple of lehengas, some of which were my mum's and some from my grandma on my dad's side.  With my mum's, I like to style them as she wore them which is pretty traditional and really lean into the 80s style with fluffy hair and major winged eyeliner but I normally add a statement piece of jewellery to make it mine.  My grandma's I tend to mix up with different styles of blouses, different scarves and wear as more of a mishmash to fit in with the trends at the moment. One of the saris she gave, I've had made into a lehenga with two different blouses and the skirt into a ruffled, almost flamenco kind of skirt because the material really suits that kind of thing.

Outfits always cute, but accessible/not over the top

If I‚Äôm excited about something else, then so be lol  For expensive items, I do the same but also find an excuse (holiday, birthday, publish a paper, etc.)

text:How did you curate/purge your wardrobe specifically for moving? What pieces did you bring when moving to a drastically different climate? What other fashion moving tips do people have?	labels:I live in a small space so I try to make my pieces wearable throughout the year. I always wear a cami, jeans/shorts, and ankle boots. My open knit cardigan works all year round. You really have to be realistic and ask if you‚Äôre going to wear it in the next couple of years and how you‚Äôre going to store it. I would get rid of things that you could easily replace and polyester/polyamide (because it‚Äôs not as breathable and caused me bacne).   For the third piece, consider accessories. Belts, necklaces, bracelets, scarves, bags, hats, and earrings can add interest to your outfit.	episode_done:True

text:General Discussion - November 30, 2020	labels:<rant>  If I said "Wear cropped jackets so you look taller" I'd be laughed out of the room but somehow "Short people shouldn't wear long coats" is a valid thing?   Also what's defined as short? If someone is 5'7" do they get to wear long coats? What if they're 5'7.5"??  It also throws the idea out the window of the whole horizontal breaks thing that people complain about for cropped trousers or high-waisted pants. Suddenly you have a wonderful garment type that can give you long, **tall**, and elegant lines and it's impossible to wear.   People complain all the damn time about menswear being too "restrictive" and women's wear being more "exciting" but everyone is too much of a wimp to wear a ~ L O N G C O A T ~.  I fucking hate fashion "rules" and "guidelines" and literally everything having to do with the word "flattering". If you care so much about these gender norms, masculinity and being ~ flattering ~ then sack up and wear the clothes you like.   That whole thread is just people saying that someone else told them they couldn't *wear a coat* so what should they do? Oh idk. How about tell them to fuck off and wear the damn coat.  </rant>

text:What‚Äôs the comfiest material you can put in a washing machine without fuss?	labels:Rayons. You can absolutely put them in the dryer, they're less prone to pilling than cotton and definitely much softer. If you do put them in the dryer, just use the lowest setting (which you should already be doing for all your clothing - high heat settings on washers and dryers should only be used for things like towels and sheets). Air drying is, obviously, less hard on *all* clothing and so you should opt for it whenever possible to extend the life of your clothing, but I wouldn't say it's *necessary* for rayons. They don't need to be dried flat, so a laundry rack or hanging them to dry in some other way is totally fine. I don't hand wash anything, either, tbh. I put delicates in a wash bag and wash all clothing in cold water on the delicate cycle, but that's about as far as I'm willing to go. I pretty much exclusively wear soft/smooth fabrics due to sensory issues, and that works well enough for me.	episode_done:True

text:what pieces/brands did you buy when moving from a warmer climate to a cooler climate? what did you end up regretting/not using?	labels:Many years ago I moved from Hawaii to college in the Northeast. I would recommend 1) Buying it all there, because they'll have what's good for their climate and 2) starting out with cheaper options (thrifted, Old Navy, Target range) even if it's not quite your style. Don't spend much time, effort, and money until you see how you really feel after at least a year of seasons. Maybe you want warmer stuff than you thought you would, or realize you should invest in nicer socks, or discover you don't actually like turtlenecks, or shift to a different style when you're surrounded by a new area's vibe. Let yourself experience it for a bit without pressuring yourself to do it all right.

Plus I used to make beadwork jewelry and accessories before my arthritis got so sucky and I made several bolo ties of my own beading around gemstone cabachons.

text:What are your favorite colorful brands?	labels:Alice and Olivia has a good collection of colorful fun clothes, and I like they‚Äôre quality. They have sales often, which makes the prices more palatable.	episode_done:True
text:How much was your most expensive fashion item and when or how often do you wear it?	labels:My most expensive items have all been high quality copies of items I have in low quality but wore out the wazoo.  For example, I knew I was ready to invest in some high end Chelsea boots when I found myself going through a cheap pair every year. Or to invest in a nice leather-looking jacket when I found myself grabbing mine 70% of the time I went out.  The expensive items were hard to wear at first, maybe on date nights or to a nicer event, but as I got more used to wearing them I wore them more often. I think it took me a hot year before I wore my Red Wings more than like once a month.   My recommendation is keep the items in your comfort zone (so no wild dresses or Colors at first) and to force yourself to wear it at a regular interval. These days, just wearing nice jeans while I go shopping seems to be my ‚Äúdate night‚Äù when I dress up!

text:My Gucci Addiction: Vanity Fair editor Buzz Bissinger's essay about spending $638k on clothes	labels:The line in the piece that stuck out for me was when he said he was on medication for "mild bipolarity."  The out-of-control spending, the hypersexuality, the losing a job due to temper outbursts...I'm not a psychiatrist, I just play one on the internet, but all of that put together  sounds like, at the very least, untreated hypomania.  To pass it off as only shopping addiction or "discovering himself" seems like underplaying some serious mental illness.
text:Regular people have mental illness.  Rich people have *glamorous* mental illness	labels:Exactly. Regular people are hoarders. Rich people are ‚ú®eccentric
text:I‚Äôve seen people say this, but tbh hoarding is something completely different from eccentricity. Rich or not, if your living space is unsanitary because you have too much crap in your house or your spending addiction damages your life, then you‚Äôre a hoarder.  If you just have unconventional style or make whimsical choices (like carefully curating an unusual collection) then you‚Äôre eccentric.   These words have completely different definitions.	labels:It is, of course, but for a lot of reasons mental illness in wealthy people gets labeled as eccentricity long after it would be called what it is for the rest of us. If you‚Äôve got a huge house and help to clean it, you can hoard a lot more for a lot longer before you hit that unsanitary state you mention, for instance.	episode_done:True

It was kinda funny seeing kids rock their NF Steep Tech jackets to class when we don‚Äôt get THAT much snow here. My wardrobe now mostly consists of Patagonia, LL Bean, and North Face. I love the retro designs from the 90s that are coming back.   I have to say, Patagonia is by far my favorite brand. Quality pieces that both look good and are practical that last for years.

text:Is Money Important for Style? - The Style and Direction Podcast	labels:Money is neither necessary nor sufficient for style, but it's extremely helpful. You can be all style, no money, with thrifty finds, but you'll always be limited. And you can be all money, no style, which we see often enough.  But if you want the style, almost inevitably you're going to need the money.

text:The joy of cordovan‚Äîand how to wear and maintain it	labels:Cordovan is an Instagram dream - it‚Äôs lustrous and has a ton of color depth. Unfortunately I find  actually wearing it is a different story. It‚Äôs extremely stiff and inflexible, especially during the first 20-30 wears. It‚Äôs the coldest leather I‚Äôve ever worn (like my feet are freezing even with medium wool socks). On the flip side, they are super warm in anything over 75 degrees so I avoid them in summer. Spotting in the rain is incredibly annoying so I‚Äôve just avoided wearing them in high temps, whereas my calf boots are completely fine in summer. Also, they are on dainite soles which are terrible in winter snow or slush.   I‚Äôm glad I own a pair of color 8 Alden 986, and my Viberg bourbon shell service boots. They are great for certain occasions. But in sum, I have a pair of ~$1300 boots that I generally can wear between 40-75 degrees Fahrenheit when there‚Äôs no precipitation or inclement weather. Keep that in mind before you jump into the shell world.

text:The Instagram Account Showing ‚ÄúIvy‚Äôs‚Äù More Eclectic Side ‚Äì Put This On	labels:First point; /r/NavyBlazer is cringe because people legitimately think it is a lifestyle.

It‚Äôs really a cesspool.   Ivy is a breakdown of ‚ÄòTrad‚Äô style, whichever way you cut it leaves room for interpretation and that‚Äôs the beauty of it. The whole point of Ivy style was rebellion. Kids were tired of wearing the same uniform their fathers wore, so they decided to wear their sweaters under jackets, sneakers with ties, etc.

text:General Discussion - November 12, 2020	labels:I ordered a new saddle for my bike.  Immediately after ordering, I saw a promotion for 15% off my first order.  I sent a request within 5 minutes for that promotion to be retroactively applied (processing change, price adjustment, partial refund, cancel and reorder, whatever), and they basically said "no".  Returns are free.  I am going to ship this goddamn thing back across the Atlantic and they are going to lose out more on shipping than they would have just giving me the discount, plus the cost of a sale.  EDIT: I should be naming and shaming, it's Brooks y'all.
text:Similar experience with END Clothing.  My friend asked for wallet suggestions for her BF and she settled on a new one full price from END, shipped to the US. Shipping was ~$12. Return policy is 30 days, but you have to ship it back to the UK on your own dime.  It gets delivered 7 days later. Next day, END starts their seasonal sale and the wallet gets reduced by $70. Wallet is still in stock. I help her message support for a price adjustment, and they told her to shove it.   Regardless of whether she had already opened and used the wallet (she hadn't, because it's a gift...), she *could* place a new order at the lower price, wait less than a week for it to be delivered and ship the new one back on the first order for a full refund minus shipping.  We explained this to the reps and they said 'ok, you're free to do that.'  Nevermind that we'd be shipping the identical wallet across the world and then back for no fucking reason. Nevermind that we'd be out another $20+ for having to pay return shipping on a small item to the UK AND their shipping fee on the second order. I even asked if they could refund the adjustment amount minus the shipping. Nope.  Fuck END, fuck their policies. Support Mr. Porter or SSENSE instead.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:What style rules or clothing attributes are you ruthless about?	labels:Also, this is a common rule, but no clothing that requires anything special to wear it - eg a shirt that only works when you switch around the bra straps of your convertible bra, a dress that requires shapewear to look how you want it to look, a wrap blouse that has to be pinned into place after you put it on, a shirt that requires another shirt underneath because it‚Äôs see-through - all of those are a no for me. If it doesn‚Äôt work with just my regular underclothing (except for choosing nude underclothing for light pieces) I won‚Äôt buy it - I just know by now I‚Äôm not going to make the effort to wear it when I could just put on something easier that I like just as much.

text:Does anyone have tips on how to find good stuff from Poshmark and other online thrift shopping platforms?	labels:Some really great tips here! Here's my two cents:  1) If the seller doesn't respond to your questions, RESIST the urge to buy anyway. This seems really obvious, but I've made the mistake many times of panic-buying b/c I was afraid I'd miss out on the item, against my better judgment. Someone else may snap it up, but you've saved yourself the headache of wasting money on something that doesn't fit/is damaged/itchy/smells like cigarette smoke/etc.   2) Poshmark and eBay work better when you are familiar with the exact brand and model of clothing. They're not great for browsing due to just too much crap and too much inconsistency in the listings. If you don't really know what you want, I'd suggest browsing TheRealReal. They skew higher-end, but have a quite a lot of choice and have filtered out the trash and no-name brands already. Often you can find really rock-bottom prices for what you're getting (like Rag & Bone jeans for $30). You can search for something like "women's wool trousers" and then filter by size and color and sometimes style (cropped, wide-leg, etc). You'll be exposed to a lot of brands and styles you may not otherwise have thought of. Another pro (or con, depending on how you look at it), is that the clothing sizes are broken down into XS/S/M/L/XL categories, rather than numerical. So if you filter by "S" it will include 26-27 jeans, 34-36 Euro sizing, 40-42 IT size, etc., which is good when you're dealing with international brands. Even better is when the item includes measurements, which they often do, which are always more helpful than a number on a tag. Finally, on full-priced items (except for the really high end stuff), you can automatically get 20% by using their REAL code.	episode_done:True

text:FAQ: What are people's experiences with clothing challenges like trying not to buy clothes for a year/only buying second hand? What are some tips?	labels:I try my best to only buy during sales and when I buy it's under two circumstances. The first if I need something that I don't have that are absolute necessaties such as work pants, or to update a particular item if a similar item is found that offers the same benefits if not more e.g. old, thinning bomber jacket vs insulated bomber jacket.  I haven't bought any new casual button downs or dress shirts in a year since I'm satisfied with my current collection and most likely it'll be the same for the upcoming year.  For shoes,  I live in an area that's notorious for its weather so I take extra precaution on wearing the proper footwear to and from work or the gym inorder to extend the life of the shoes. Annual cleaning and maintenance is necessary.  Note: It helps to wear items for their intended purposes. I  wear jeans at times but I don't go camping or hiking in them, nor do I wear them when it's exceptionally hot or humid. I have an interest in raw denim and have heard stories of people wearing their raws for everything in order to get fades. I don't do that. Same thing applies to welted boots.	episode_done:True

text:General Discussion - November 30, 2020	labels:<rant>  If I said "Wear cropped jackets so you look taller" I'd be laughed out of the room but somehow "Short people shouldn't wear long coats" is a valid thing?   Also what's defined as short? If someone is 5'7" do they get to wear long coats? What if they're 5'7.5"??  It also throws the idea out the window of the whole horizontal breaks thing that people complain about for cropped trousers or high-waisted pants. Suddenly you have a wonderful garment type that can give you long, **tall**, and elegant lines and it's impossible to wear.   People complain all the damn time about menswear being too "restrictive" and women's wear being more "exciting" but everyone is too much of a wimp to wear a ~ L O N G C O A T ~.  I fucking hate fashion "rules" and "guidelines" and literally everything having to do with the word "flattering". If you care so much about these gender norms, masculinity and being ~ flattering ~ then sack up and wear the clothes you like.   That whole thread is just people saying that someone else told them they couldn't *wear a coat* so what should they do? Oh idk. How about tell them to fuck off and wear the damn coat.  </rant>

text:Grad/Masters Fashion Program Reality?	labels:If your goal is to start your own brand or become a fashion designer, or work in the fashion industry on the design and creative side, a marketing degree is an order of magnitude more valuable than a fashion design degree (granted, it should ideally be from a fashion school or a highly respected school). Everyone and their born-rich roommate in NYC has a fashion design degree just because they're interested in fashion and didn't know what to study in uni. In these industries with oversupply of graduates (who are willing to work for less than you), your goal should be to be significantly more valuable than your competitors. Having a marketing double major is one way, though it's also not very uncommon and you will still have significant competition.

text:Who else has sensory issues that has figured out ways to not dress boring?	labels:I'm autistic and I have a lot of sensory issues so I can relate. I've found that wearing a layer underneath other things helps. For example, I have uniqlo leggings and a long-sleeve undershirt that I know I like the feeling of against my skin, so if I want to wear a sweater that's kind of scratchy or something else similar I'll just wear an undershirt that protects me. Another thing that helps me is tight sleeveless undershirts tucked into my jeans/skirt/bottom half whatever so that my shirt and waistband don't rub against my skin. (edit: I don't know if this will work in warmer climates, it works where I'm from because it's cold pretty much all year)  I also have a strict policy of not buying things that I know I'll find uncomfortable (and that I don't have a workaround for), wishing that maybe this time it will work. Because it won't, I'll just wear the thing out once and feel bad the entire time and then feel guilty for never wearing it again. If I find something that I really love, I cling to that and try to find similar things in the future and things that will complement those items.	episode_done:True
text:Can you build a wardrobe off Amazon?	labels:A huge chunk of my wardrobe is built out from Amazon. I add everything to a list, and wait until Amazon's algorithms decide they need to sell it for $6. They also offer Tall sizes on quite a lot of items, which is great for having sleeves that fit.  Uniqlo for jeans, Amazon's Peak Velocity brand for Tshirts, and Goodthreads for everything else is what I would do if I had to start from Scratch.  If there's a certain type of item your looking for, feel free to ask for recommendations and I can send you a link to what I'd look at.
text:Thanks for sharing!   Items I'm looking for:  \- White sneakers - preferably leather   \- Jeans - Slim/skinny light blue, navy, black   \- Jackets - from bomber jackets to other non-bomber kinds  \- Sweaters or sweatshirts I can layer under my jacket  \- Long sleeve shirts/henleys  \- boots   If you've come across any of these on amazon that you think may be decent purchase I'd love to check it out	labels:Amazon has pretty decent t-shirts and sweatshirts (not knit sweaters!) that you can get for a good price. You can also buy some decent quality sneakers from Amazon too, just make sure it's from a reputable seller and from a recognized shoe brand (Adidas/New Balance/etc.).  &#x200B;  However, for stuff like jeans, jackets, boots, and knitwear, I'd look elsewhere. I've bought jeans from Amazon in the past that came with low-quality buttons and ripped after 2 months of wear, so I don't think the quality is quite there. My recommendation would be to search on places like Uniqlo/Carhartt/Champion or even thrift stores to get better quality jeans/jackets/knitwear that can last you a lot longer than whatever you'd find on Amazon for a comparable price.
text:Yeah - I wouldn't skimp on denim and footwear. A nice pair of boots that will last years and grow patina, same with denim fades. You can skimp a bit on the rest -    for example today I'm wearing: $300 Samurai Jeans, $x00 boots, $x00 vintage watch - but paired with an $8 Hanes cotton/poly sweatshirt from amazon and $5 generic khaki hat from walmart.	labels:Just seconding what others have said about denim, while I love good denim and definitely see the value of a $300 pair, it's definitely possible to skimp on denim and still have it last for years. Of course it won't look as nice as a more expensive pair, but if your goal is just to look presentable then cheaper denim can do the trick imo!	episode_done:True

text:General Discussion - December 11, 2020	labels:After looking at the casual blazer thread I just realized why I never liked or understood Paul Harnden when it was really big a few years ago. I think a lot of it was shoehorned into a more aggressive aesthetic than would suit some of those blazers. And we were still steeped in slim fit bottoms at the time, and people just threw a long, looser fit blazer over tight black twisted leg pants and called it a day. I think it's a great look when it's cohesive, but it came across as very bandwagon-y when it was worn with your typical Julius and BBS type stuff.  Interestingly, Elena Dawson - which is the same thing - was typically worn more cohesively, and I always really liked her work.

text:Learning to dress better	labels:I would refer to the established guides in MFA first to build the foundation of developing style. Everyone's style is different (budget, size, colour preference, etc) so there isn't just some quick bullet points that can "define style". How I like to figure out style is to browse online such as websites like Highsnobiety, or Instagram accounts (@hidden.ny) and just save photos. Build up a folder that you can reference so if you see something in store that is similar to something you saw then you know what to buy.   In regards to hair, I think this is very important. There's nothing worse than spending a lot of money on a nice wardrobe but have a crappy haircut. Think of it this way; your tshirt or jeans may be worn once or twice a week at most; your hair is part of your outfit 24/7. Invest in a good haircut and products to maintain it. Growing your hair isn't an issue as there are plenty of guides for longer hairstyles.
text:I will be checking the guides (I didn't know there were some) as soon as I can!     About my hair, I think that I will go and ask advice to a professional when the lockdown is over. Thanks a lot!	labels:	episode_done:True
text:In Honor of RBG, What is your Dissent piece?	labels:In my last company I was given feedback that perhaps I should wear less jewelry when I went to head office in Germany. I loved my daily wear gold jewelry, and it was not too much by any stretch of the imagination. Just simple gold hoops, larger woven gold ring, two gold bracelets, and a metal watch. No gems, only the one ring, simple hoops. But apparently too much at HQ office   So every time from then on I wore a bigger pair of hoops and a necklace plus everything else. To hell with them.	episode_done:True
text:Ordered from Shoe The Bear (rant, experience in post)	labels:Do you have a different picture with better lighting? I think the picture on the site might be deceptive, and yours is too dark to see the difference, cognac browns can be hard to photograph. I definitely see red tones though. If it's not that, then looks like a manufacturing error and they mixed leathers up. I'd try for an exchange  before I went the return or chargeback route.	episode_done:True
text:Capsule wardrobes?	labels:I have one. It works for both my office job and casual life as I like to be dressed up when I go out. It has around 12 pieces, not including shoes,undergarments or accessories. They're in neutral colors and my pop of color comes through my accessories (normally glasses or shoes but sometimes jewelry). I love it. I've paired it down to things I actually wear and slowly I've been replacing my fast fashion items when they're beyond wear with things that match my morals now. it's def a bit more pricier now but I feel good wearing them and know they'll last.	episode_done:True
text:How do I figure out my "style"?	labels:I recommend doing two things:   1 - look at your current wardrobe and pick out what outfits you consider your favorite. Ask yourself why you gravitate to those items. Is it a color? A theme? A certain look? Those are some clues to your style.   2 - if you follow fashion bloggers or general fashion posts, ask yourself why you follow them. There is a likelihood that you follow them because you like their look/style.    Now, with more insight into what style you currently have and styles you aspire to have, you may get closer to defining your style. Don't feel too bad if you can't explicitly name it (ie: preppy, vintage, casual, etc). Your personal style is more nuanced and probably a combination of multiple categories.
text:thanks :)	labels:	episode_done:True
text:How do you find your true style when you're surrounded by fast fashion?	labels:There's a lot of good advice about finding inspiration here but what really helped me is in some ways the opposite: allowing myself to be really picky. Maybe I'm just a negative person haha but it's easier for me to realize I sort of balk at wearing a particular item and then figuring out the reason it's off-putting as well as taking note of clothing I feel my best in	episode_done:True

Both also seem to include items of extended size ranges, which is also nice!
text:I too am a fan of InStyle magazine.   O, the Oprah magazine has gone digital and will only issue print magazines quarterly as of January 2021.

text:What have people actually worn to funerals you've been to?	labels:I‚Äôve been unfortunate enough to have been to two funerals in the past few years, and the idea of wearing all black to a funeral doesn‚Äôt really seem to be a thing in Australia. I wore all black both times because I thought that was what you were supposed to wear but lots of people wore casual clothing. I‚Äôm talking singlet (tank top), shorts and thongs (flip flops). I was very taken aback that people would wear that to a funeral but I guess them being there is the most important thing.
text:Im in aus and the last funeral I went too (for an elderly aunt) there were a group of early 20 year old women in melb cup crossed with club wear. They were cousins of cousins type thing.  I'm talking like orange neon body con mini mini dresses with the fake tan, huge fascinators, glittery platform stilettos. When they walked in they seemed to realise it was not appropriate and spent a lot of the church service trying to yank their dresses over their bums and looking awkward.   At my wedding my brother rocked up with holey jeans, a flanno and a bouquet of dead roses he got from the servo for free.   I'm from syd so maybe that's it because people from melb really out do us in the fashion stakes.	labels:	episode_done:True

MFA lurkers *love* to talk on and on and on about bringing back capes but literally anything else that's outside the box is met with weird stuff like "My shitty negative opinion of a general concept is equivalent to constructive criticism for a specific case of advice." Aka "I don't like this thing so no one should wear it ever."  Everything from pearls to no-show socks, henleys, denim jackets, etc. are all controversial but man capes. *Capes*.

text:How to find the confidence to wear clothes you like?	labels:If you're nervous about the look itself: I used to wear things I was iffy on when I was in a new or different place. Like, if I was worried a dress was too loud and attention-getting for my comfort level, I'd wear it when I was in a different city for the day, because if it did catch too much attention, who cares, I was never seeing these people again! Obviously this is harder to do in covid, because we aren't casually daytripping or traveling, but even just wearing the outfit to the grocery store, where you're probably not going to know everyone, vs wearing it in the office, where you see the same people all the time can ease you into being comfortable...	episode_done:True

text:The finances of curating a high-end wardrobe through luxury resale: how much do you spend on clothing taking into account resale revenue?	labels:I used to buy a lot of high end stuff, mostly bags and shoes, with occasional clothing pieces in there. It was definitely easier to spend more knowing I could recoup something.   The problem was that I was never really honest with myself about what I could realistically sell things for, because it started to become justification if that makes sense at all. I never bought things with the intention of reselling them later, but it made it easier. It was always like ‚Äú$1000 is a lot for this bag, but I can sell for 800, so it‚Äôs not that expensive.‚Äù In reality, it would sell for more like 500, and it would take a long time to sell. And then occasionally, I‚Äôd end up with something that I like, but that no one else really did, and it‚Äôs hard to sell something for pennies when you handed over hundreds. It‚Äôs a lot of psychological warfare with yourself, or at least it was for me. It also doesn‚Äôt help that selling high end designer pieces is much harder than selling mall stuff ‚Äî a lot of fraud, a lot of entitled buyers *and* sellers, and just a lot of headache overall.   These days, I don‚Äôt buy nearly as much luxury stuff, and I try to buy mostly secondhand. I still resell some stuff, but I try to buy more classic things that I‚Äôll keep for awhile. Resale factor does come into play, but if I‚Äôm honest, I have a list of things I need to sell, but haven‚Äôt taken the time to do.	episode_done:True
text:MFA Brand MegaReview: Zara | January 30, 2021	labels:2012 through about 2014 I was out of college, unemployed for stretches, underemployed for others, and underpaid for the rest. After being unemployed post-college in 2012 and living with my parents, and then my entire annual income in 2013 was about $13,000 while I was living on my own, and somewhere around $20,000 in 2014. I had some freelance gigs here and there where I could pull in $500 or $1000 bucks outside my reported income, but I was ostensibly "living in poverty" for a few years.  Zara was honestly kind of a godsend in that period, I needed somewhat fashionable clothing but had basically no money to spend on it. I work in the contemporary art world and dressing well is literally part of my job. While Zara isn't exactly highly respected, I was able to get some decent looking clothing on the cheap.  Today I find it easy to criticize Zara, whether it's the stolen designs, or the fast fashion model, or the inconsistent sizing, the sweatshop labor, and so on, but I admit that for a moment in my life they were a really useful utility. When I didn't have money for clothes but I needed decent looking clothes, Zara was one of the best options available to me. There's a lot of better options in the world if you have time and money, as I do now, but I'd be a hypocrite to ignore the benefit they provided me when I had neither time nor money.  Also while they're not exactly a "buy it for life" brand, their clothes didn't fall apart on me either, so, I'll give them props for that. Everything lasted an appropriate amount of time for the price.

About $1500 gone.

text:As Chanel Raises Prices For A Second Time this Year, What Do Luxury Brands‚Äô Inflating Prices Mean for Them & for the Industry at Large?	labels:Luxury brands inflating prices means creating another pricepoint at higher categories. When fashion tees at $300 a pop becomes the norm, why wouldn't the luxury brands jack up the price on other products to increase their margins?  The only way this can be curbed is through the consumers. When we stop falling into the hype cycle and scramble to buy up everything just for the gram and social media likes, these products will sit and go into the 50-60% off discount during the sale seasons. All these brands have data; when they see that stuff is sitting and mostly selling at lower price points, they'll need to curb their expectations and set price points accordingly.   It doesn't help right now during COVID that I see people whose jobs/income did not get affected by COVID, and therefore has additional disposable income because they aren't eating out, partying etc. They justify spending more on items at MSRP instead of waiting for a sale.

text:What are your favorite, trusted clothing lines for buying wear-forever investment classics?	labels:For cashmere specifically, you should try Pringle of Scotland, Johnston of Elgin, and Agnona on resell sites. They are top tier cashmere brands but not " well known" like Brunello Cuccinelli or Loro Piana. Brora is also very good quality but their styles can be a little "JC Penny" or "Kohls‚Äù catalog. I don't know how you describe it, but yeah.  Otherwise, what immediately came to mind for me is Adam Lippes. It's insanely expensive, up there with your ‚Äúfashion house designers‚Äù but unlike those, it's not super well known and not an "it-brand" so there's not a lot of fakes floating around. I thrift it off of Ebay, the RealReal, and occasionally discount sites and never worry about authenticating it the way I would for say, Chanel, Dior, Gucci, Prada etc. I'm no stranger to designer goods but their material and construction is absolutely amazing. Like the highest quality, weightiest fabric you can imagine. Honestly you could wear their shirts inside out because the hems are finished so perfectly, it'd be hard to tell.   Another one that I love that I NEVER hear of is Petar Petrov. What that brand does with silk is frankly incredible. The colors and cuts (especially their very flattering body skimming bias cuts) are stunning in person and nothing like any kind other designer I‚Äôve ever seen. Again pricey pricey, but not popular/not high in demand so a diligent online shopper could thrift it more easily.  Sometimes even with truly luxury designer, I feel like the consumer is paying for the logo-bling, design and but necessarily quality. But these two luxury brands are IMO consistently both design and quality and no visible logos.

Just purchased a huge $900 squash blossom necklace and have worn it constantly. My boots range from $30 for a secondhand pair to $750 for custom made and none are worn more or less than the others.  When my mother passed, she was 88. I went to clean out her closet and drawers and found so many lovely things that were carefully boxed away or wrapped in tissue that she was ‚Äúsaving for good‚Äù. Ironically, ‚Äúgood‚Äù apparently never came as these things went unused.  I decided right then to never do that. Every day is special and I am worth taking the time to look and feel special even if I‚Äôm just out running errands.

text:Just how revolutionary is Harry Styles‚Äô Vogue cover?	labels:I like the gesture a lot and things like this make me as a queer person feel more safe...  *however*, that doesn't stop me from saying I think this shoot was poorly styled. The looks just don't do it for me and in some ways they look incomplete. It looks like he decided to wear a dress the day he showed up to the shoot. It just seems, for lack of a better term, lazy. Like they didn't really care what this meant. He needed more hair and makeup work in my opinion. Something to make people look at it and be like "wow, he looks really pretty and I bet he feels it‚Äù  or some eye color would've pulled the whole thing together. Or a pretty necklace! I think lacking these little details is why people will say he didn't pull it off and is sort of a let down considering what this symbolizes. Open to hearing from other people who support the look, tho

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE!- October 21	labels:Can anyone point out wool blend differences? Seeing 60% wool with some nylon vs some wool with cashmere, some with poly and some with a mixture of all. What‚Äôs the difference between these different blends and what can anyone recommend for an overcoat ? (like a car coat). Thanks from now
text:the poly/nylon fiber is usually used as a monofilament core of the yarn which then weaved into garment.  one of the purpose is to add strength and durability to the garment at a lower cost because better wool that can be spun into weaving yarn of the same durability as synthetic blend is more expensive.  other than that, the synthetic core also adds wrinkle and shrink resistance because again, they're the core of the weaving yarn which means the wool fibers that wrap around them more or less follows the behavior of the core.  one of the negative aspect of synthetic core yarn is reduced warmth. wool fibers aren't exactly solid, it have a lot of microscopic air pockets that acts as insulator (in the same method of down filling insulates body heat). monofilament synthetic yarns don't have this, which makes it less warm.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What was your "how in the name of all that is holy did this end up in a thrift store" find?	labels:It‚Äôs less about the value of the item and more about the stars aligning perfectly.  I wear a size 12-13W shoe, plus other things that make my feet really hard to fit, so I am used to buying formalwear to match the one maybe two pairs of formal shoes I own at any given time.  So when I was 17 and going to prom in 2006, my mom tried really hard to help me find shoes, any shoes, that were suitable. But we could only find casual flats or runners, and I realllly wanted to dress up nicely for the first real time in my life. So she said ‚Äúyou know what, let‚Äôs buy a dress and then we will just have to find a way.‚Äù  So I picked out a black and pale pink dress that just made me swoon, and I figured black heels would be easiest to find. Lol I was so young and stupid.  Anyway we searched high and low right up until the week of prom, we drove to the US from Canada and looked there and I still couldn‚Äôt find a pair of heels that fit enough to buy and I decided I‚Äôd just wear uncomfy like always and deal with it.   Then I randomly walked into a thrift store and saw on the shoe rack a pair of pink heels in the exact shade of pink on my dress, with black trim. Picked them up, size 12W. They fit like they were made for me.   Wore them until they broke three years ago.
text:Okay this isn't a thrifting tip, but my feet are similar, and I've got a heel finding tip for you: Drag  With how big drag has become in the last few years there are a lot of online shops that cater to Queens who have a hard time finding shoes that are big and wide enough.  Lots of cute heeled shoe, sandal and boot options out there!	labels:That was my first thought. I lived very near a gay bar with regular drag shows. This was in the early ‚Äô80s. The only drawback to living in the neighborhood was trying to find pantyhose for work, that fit my frame.	episode_done:True

I have plenty from like j.crew and madewell but I feel like they don't hold up for as long as I want.

text:Agreed that showing you midriff is inappropriate and a big no no professionally. Even in the epitome of casualness in tech I would caution against it. However, one can wear crop tops without showing skin. You can wear an undershirt and high waisted bottoms (skirt/dress as underlay/pants).

text:When to start saving clothes for your children?	labels:My Mum saved some of her clothing for me. I really cherish the pieces she gave me. My favourite is a black velvet dress she wore a lot in her mid twenties. She also saved some of my nicest baby clothes, so I could use them with my future daughters.  Almost all the items that she saved were high quality velvet, lace and silk. They also were in solid colors.   In most instances it was items she didn't fit in anymore but had an emotional attachment to, so they stayed in the back of her closet until I hit my late teens. She made most of the items, a couple were purchased, and some were made for her. Since she has a talent for sewing and repair, all the items were kept in top condition. She didn't give me all the pieces at once. She would offer to lend me a dress for an event, and I'd try it on. Then she would tell me the story behind it, and say it was mine if I wanted it.   I have wool coats and leather jackets that I'm using currently, but will put away for future generations when they don't fit anymore or I change up my style. After an unfortunate pen in the laundry mishap I've also considered purchasing doubles of items I really enjoy. If something happens I'll have a spare. If nothing does I'll have a vintage-with-tags gift for future children ‚ò∫Ô∏è purchasing items specifically for future generations seems a bit high pressure though..  My Mum also saved shoes and boots for me but our shoe size is different so that didn't work out unfortunately.   My husband (at 30yo) is saving some clothes he felt he had grown out of for any future sons we may have. It's stored in the attic.   Solid pieces in quality materials that are cared for and stored properly are likely to be received well. I'm thankful my Mum saved her best clothing over the years for me. Obviously saving every ragged Walmart t shirt is going to become a case of hoarding like other posters mentioned. But if it's a reasonable amount of high quality pieces and you have storage space then why not? It's family heirlooms and history.	episode_done:True

As I am very much an  'other' at work and stick out like a sore thumb anyway, i tend to peacock. I love bright coloured suits and dresses, purposeful makeup (as in, bright eyeshadow or lipstick) and I tend to over match in what is arguably an unfashionable way, according to FFA. It makes me feel good, and I think you can get away with more daring choices in hot climates. I am also very influenced by my recently passed grandma, who had an incredible amount of clothes and always looked impeccable- and very matchy like me!  However, since corona has struck and i've had my livelihood dwindle to nothing....I have take a pedestrian job for a year.

text:The suit looks dark grey to my eye, though monitor may be misleading.  If it is indeed dark grey/charcoal, I would not recommend navy pants, I'd suggest a lighter grey with no pattern that is very noticeably lighter than the jacket. Agree with the above poster that the goal here isn't to match, but to contrast in a... Controlled... way, especially since you're planning for a funeral.  White shirt, simple/plain tie in any dark color (black or grey would be traditional for a funeral, but dark blue, burgundy, or dark green would be fine as well).	labels:My monitor leads me to mid greyish.... if it's on a darker spectrum, probably black slacks could do either, although depends on the colour of a pair of shoes.
text:So a few shades darker is what I am looking for, even if that is black? Fortunately my field is the visual arts, so I confident picking out shades as long as I know what I am shooting for.	labels:The key to an effective odd jacket/trouser combo is enough difference in the two that you won't mistake them for a suit.   The challenge in this case comes from being limited to a sober palette. You can get that difference though pattern (patterned jacket w/solid trousers), shade of colour, or texture (flannel texture of trousers)

If you wear a lot of solids and neutrals - dip your toe in with a great coat. A coat in a fun color, maybe even a patterned coat. Wear that daily.  If you don't want to commit to a coat, get one "loud" patterned item. The easiest way to pair it is to pull out one of the colors in the pattern and that is what you wear it with. Instead of using the neutral, use one of the accent colors.  And number 3 is color blocking. That one is super easy. You just pick two solids, but skip the neutrals.

text:What are your favorite, trusted clothing lines for buying wear-forever investment classics?	labels:For cashmere specifically, you should try Pringle of Scotland, Johnston of Elgin, and Agnona on resell sites. They are top tier cashmere brands but not " well known" like Brunello Cuccinelli or Loro Piana. Brora is also very good quality but their styles can be a little "JC Penny" or "Kohls‚Äù catalog. I don't know how you describe it, but yeah.  Otherwise, what immediately came to mind for me is Adam Lippes. It's insanely expensive, up there with your ‚Äúfashion house designers‚Äù but unlike those, it's not super well known and not an "it-brand" so there's not a lot of fakes floating around. I thrift it off of Ebay, the RealReal, and occasionally discount sites and never worry about authenticating it the way I would for say, Chanel, Dior, Gucci, Prada etc. I'm no stranger to designer goods but their material and construction is absolutely amazing. Like the highest quality, weightiest fabric you can imagine. Honestly you could wear their shirts inside out because the hems are finished so perfectly, it'd be hard to tell.   Another one that I love that I NEVER hear of is Petar Petrov. What that brand does with silk is frankly incredible. The colors and cuts (especially their very flattering body skimming bias cuts) are stunning in person and nothing like any kind other designer I‚Äôve ever seen. Again pricey pricey, but not popular/not high in demand so a diligent online shopper could thrift it more easily.  Sometimes even with truly luxury designer, I feel like the consumer is paying for the logo-bling, design and but necessarily quality. But these two luxury brands are IMO consistently both design and quality and no visible logos.

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - January 08, 2021	labels:Just wanted to say that every time I saw an item I liked on inspiration albums and asked for ID here, the item was like over $500 and the "cheap" alternative somthing like 200-300$.   As someone  whose budget is not even close to that (I've always bought 40$ pants, 70-80$ shoes and max 100$ jackets) knowing this it's quite depressing
text:Look at our wiki, in the section on item recommendations. There should be a megathread for everything.  Relatively good cheap brands you might like include Spier and Mackay, Uniqlo, and Abercrombie & Fitch.  Do not get dress shoes for $70-80 new. They *will* be bad at that price.	labels:	episode_done:True

Regardless I would never buy one without trying it on first because that's literally the only jumpsuit I've ever tried on that didn't awkwardly ride up my crotch and make me look like a toddler...	labels:I‚Äôm smaller on top and my favorite thing in the world right now are drop crotch jumpsuits, totally solves that problem.

text:What is your one clothing item that makes your life better that everyone should have?	labels:A well fitted black wool coat in a cut that flatters you. It goes with any outfit. You can dress it up or down, and on early mornings taking the kids to school or late night runs to the store you look like you have your shit together even if your sans bra and wearing 3 day old leggings.
text:This! Though it could really be any colour that flatters you and goes with most of your wardrobe. I have a bit of a wool coat obsession, but it started with a black one back in 2010. The longer and more luxurious, the better...  Come to think of it, a good wool coat, a cashmere turtleneck and a pretty pair of block heeled ankle boots all landed in my wardrobe at the same time that year. I didn't have a lot of clothes at the time, so it was a big, instant level-up.	labels:	episode_done:True

Standard fare from Mom, with love, but without style. Relegated to the back of the drawer for periods and lazy Sundays.  7 pairs for each day of the week? Nay. 7 pairs for 17 years of wear. Holes? No a one. Elastic still intact, colors just as vibrant as the day they were unwrapped. They have outlived boyfriends and apartments.   They are the Nokia 3310 of underwear.

text:Is fast fashion really fast fashion if you get years of use out of the garments?	labels:I love that you brought this up. Of course, there are are ethical retailers out there that have lower prices, but if you are young and/or poor, there is a certain amount of fast fashion that you need to buy because it fits your price/budget. Even though it isn‚Äôt ideal, not all fast fashion is gone in a couple years, if you are buying less trendy pieces you can wear for a while.  Many things I‚Äôve bought from fast fashion retailers I‚Äôve had for years - I haven‚Äôt changed my height or weight much in over 10 years, so I have tops from Old Navy I have had for 10 years and other clothes that have lasted way past 5 years.  Reducing consumption is a key part of ethical fashion and even if you buy it from a retailer that is cheaper because that‚Äôs what you can afford, if you keep it a long time and don‚Äôt buy a bunch of clothes all the time, you are reducing demand and helping the environment.	episode_done:True

text:Does anyone have a "uniform"?	labels:I often buy multiples of items I love. I bought several of the same cardigan after I realized that I wore it more than any other sweater I owned. It's great!  Another thing I do is, when I see an item I like, I mentally run through my closet and see if it will mesh with what I already own. If it works, I get it. If I'd have to buy several new items to make it work, I don't. For this reason, I don't own many t-shirts, but I do own lots of sweaters and dresses.
text:That‚Äôs the biggest life lesson I‚Äôve carried on from one of my high school teachers - if you find you truly love an item of clothing, it‚Äôs worth the time to go back and get it in every color (that‚Äôll fit your wardrobe).   Now if only I were the type to recognize immediately that I love an item instead of waiting until it‚Äôs no longer sold, that‚Äôd be grand.	labels:Not sure if you already know, but r/findfashion helps with these situations	episode_done:True
text:How do some people put outfits together so effortlessly. Fashionista's please help.	labels:Hi! Former stylist.  1) Pay attention to the fit of things and figure out what cuts and shapes look good on you. Paper bag pants and some joggers have similar fits. Some mini skirts and shorts hit the same place on your legs and can have the same waist height. Find your sweet spot and don‚Äôt be afraid to buy multiple things in silhouettes that work for you.   2) Get some statement pieces that you would die for. If you are wearing a pair of jeans that fit well and a t-shit purchased within the past 3 years with some awesome earrings you going to look and feel great. If you are wearing an amazing dress and simple white sneakers you are going to look and feel great. Don‚Äôt overthink things but try and wear at LEAST one piece you are excited about at a time.   3) Don‚Äôt buy things just cause they are on sale, you saw your friend wearing it, or you feel like you ‚Äúneed‚Äù something in your wardrobe. You should love everything in your closet in its own special way unless it‚Äôs workwear and you hate your dress code for work. Something as simple as a T-shirt has so many different factors like cut, material, neckline, sleeve length. Purchase what feels good and don‚Äôt bother with the rest.

It‚Äôs easy to make impulse purchases when the deals are hot.   The discounts will be big this year due to the decrease of retail sales and the increase of online shopping. I think it would be helpful to post the deals as soon as they‚Äôre announced by the retailers, which could be as early as next week.

text:What do you think are the pieces of jewelry everyone should own?	labels:I don‚Äôt know about ‚Äúeveryone should own,‚Äù but I have a pair of square opal studs that I wear allll the time. The white goes with everything, the colored specks add interest, the shape is unique, and they don‚Äôt look as fancy as pearls. I can wear them grocery shopping or to an event. I love opals so much!
text:Opals are so lovely. I would agree here, jewelry can be so subjective I would say pearl, diamond, gold and silver/white gold studs (or good looking imitations of any/all depending on budget) are good any occasion go to pieces. Even a standard pearl necklace or even studs isn‚Äôt necessarily going to be something someone with an edgier asthmatic would go for, I think standards fall more in to categories- daily wear, statement and fancy. For more of an upper class type of vibe I‚Äôd say for necklaces a diamond collar style or choker for fancy, pearl strand and perhaps something with a tasteful small scale  pendant or single colored stone for everyday and a funky maybe chunky mixed metals or stones piece for statement. Edgier might be a sharp glitter crusted but not over large ice pick pendant (icicle? Skinny inverted triangle shape...I‚Äôm sure they are called something else but I cannot think of the proper name) on a standard 18-20‚Äù braided or box chain for everyday, large round stone on a long  chain for fancy and a chain mail type collar for statement. Personally my go to pendants are a sparkly star which was my first real diamond jewelry and a cz unicorn my husband got me on a thin but not super fine chain and rose gold bezel set cz studs for every day. Little dress I change up the earrings to something with a dangle and if I‚Äôm going fancy I have a choker (on me) with white gold alternating small ‚Äòbars‚Äô and geometric balls and I add a long chain with a chunky pendant. Favorite statement piece is a Betsy Johnson with a large fixed crystal pineapple.	labels:	episode_done:True

I found the one from the sidebar but wasn‚Äôt sure if there were any new ones. Same goes for sweaters	episode_done:True
text:What are your feelings on thrifting from ‚Äúproblematic‚Äù brands?	labels:The company already made money off of the original purchase of the shirt, so you buying second hand doesn‚Äôt really benefit them in any way. If you really want the item, buying it second hand is probably the most ethical choice you can make. If someone asks where the piece is from, just say you don‚Äôt know so they won‚Äôt be tempted to buy from the brand lol
text:If you like a piece of clothing but don't want to support the brand that made it, buying it secondhand is a win-win-win situation. You get the clothing you like, the problematic brand doesn't make any money off of your purchase, and you're saving that piece of clothing from ending up in a landfill.   Another option for how you can reply when someone asks where your clothing is from is to say you thrifted it. It's the truth and it might also encourage that person to shop sustainably and secondhand instead of supporting fast fashion or otherwise unethical companies.	labels:Agreed! I love the point of stating that you thrifted it instead of focusing on the brand. It's similar to buying fur secondhand.	episode_done:True
text:General Discussion - October 29	labels:I'm watching *Next in Fashion*. I kinda like how it is *not* like Project Runway in that the challenges are not like "design a gown out of garbage", but these are great designers, they get everything they need and are supposed to make the best possible design they can, no constraints except time.  But sometimes the show feels so inconsistent. There is not a *lot* of manufactured drama, but when there is, they turn it up to 11 (and I roll my eyes so hard they might pop out). I also don't need the "human interest" tear-jerker backgrounds. Focus on the designs, ffs. They almost always do women's *and* menswear (which is great), but then for the women models they promote some kind of body shape diversity, whereas the male models are all *very* conventionally attractive. Feels half-assed. Tan France isn't half as funny as he thinks he is (more eye rolling).  Overall I enjoyed it, but I can see how it got cancelled. Netflix also did a shit job promoting it.
text:Pretty much agree. I'm not sure how real the time constraints are but they could give the designers a lot more time, given it is a design competition and not speed-tailoring.

text:When did skinny jeans go out of fashion?	labels:skinny jeans haven't been on trend since at least 2015-2016 imo. that's when mom jeans became all the rage.  That being said, skinny jeans are pretty much staples for most people. They go with a lot of outfits and make a lot of looks.   Just because something isn't currently on trend, does not mean it can't be stylish.
text:I never got on the mom jeans bandwagon to me they seemed both uncomfortable (no stretch) and unflattering.

It has to be $1 or less for me to buy it.  So if I buy a $10 shirt, I have to wear it (at least) 10 times.  I do make exceptions for special occasions, but it is 2020 so those are non-existent.  And with the exception of walking a red carpet or a black tie (or higher) level of formality, I have something in my closet that could work for the occasion (wedding, political fundraiser, etc).

text:Fashion to help your changing body and lifestyle?	labels:Me!! I am currently working through this - I actually created this new account specifically for FFA so I can feel more comfortable sharing outfits. 3 years ago I left a creative job to become a stay at home mom, and since then I had another baby and have been all over the place size-wise. Pre-kids I had a very defined personal style and was really connected to my local arts community and my wardrobe reflected that.   Now I‚Äôm kind of in a lost place (after two bouts of post-parting depression, the last one clearing up right as the pandemic started) and I have no idea how to integrate my personal style into my ‚Äúnew‚Äù lifestyle.   Currently I‚Äôm working on uploading my entire wardrobe to StyleBook, to hopefully track what I‚Äôm wearing every day to find trends so that I can clear out things I don‚Äôt wear or that don‚Äôt fit. I‚Äôve also started browsing Pinterest and Instagram a lot more to encourage myself to wear things other than sweats every day. Even though I‚Äôm at home with two toddlers all the time, I think I feel better about myself when I put on real clothes that fit and make me feel happy!   I have a long way to go but you‚Äôre not alone!	episode_done:True

text:Why Ralph Lauren Never Goes Out of Style	labels:I f***ing love old Ralph Lauren. I eat that stuff up. I agree that the quality is part of why it never goes out of style. But also Ralph Lauren is still huge and relevant today, so vintage pieces feel both en vogue and archival, a very "intellectual" take on an American classic. Like an old Herman Miller chair. It was cool then and it's cool now. And RL has infiltrated all sorts of cultures, namely hip hop and streetwear meaning the demand for it isn't just bankers. And RL has been a titan of American fashion in that he sort of figured out his formulas a while ago and hasn't changed that much. RL from the past is just as recognizable as RL from today. In my opinion it's aged unbelievably well. Old RL pieces are like darling Americana that can styled with anything. An old RL knit hangs just as well with streetwear as it does with jeans and boots. And while similar brands like BB are nice, they are one trick ponies. RL has and continues to offer an expansive product line from tech skiwear to western clothes. I think this huge line up means that even if there are duds, they are hidden by the massive catalog of hit pieces like the bear line up.
text:I think at its best, RL pulls from all the great American heritage brands:   * Prep outdoors brands like Ll Bean or Woolrich * American Trad like Brooks Bros * Western brands like Pendleton or Levi‚Äôs   And finds a way to blend them and tweak them in such correct but interesting ways.   Ralph is the ultimate Americana guy, he just gets the genre. Very Ralph is a great doc too.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Experimenting With Different Focal Lengths & Landscape || Portrait	labels:For a straight on shot, yes, a longer focal length will look more objective and usually better, as well as compress the depth of field. But, I'd say the shorter focal lengths would be more appealing if you composed the shot to take advantage of the lenses!  A wider lens will look best when you're making use of and exaggerating depth, so maybe a seated pose with the legs stretching towards camera, or shooting from below or above, getting closer to details of the subject.  I do a decent amount of photography, and I wouldn't take out a wide lens just to take the exact same shot I would've with a longer lens. Adapt your approach to your gear!
text:Thanks for responding! I agree with the last paragraph I have a 20-70 and have been shooting between 55-70 mostly for the portraits. Thanks for the ideas with getting more stylized shots with the wider lens, I'll definitely explore trying some more unique angles out.	labels:	episode_done:True

I remember about 10 years ago I saw a story about someone who took a photo a day of their face over an extended period of time and I was floored by the commitment and the progression of how much someone changes facially.  It was presented in one of those flip-book-esque ways.    I was intrigued by the idea of taking a photo a day as some sort of time capsule/chronicle and started taking outfit photos when it was somewhat shameful and indulgent (at least to me then) but now I have a whole archive of outfits from ten years ago.  It does chronicle emotions and whatever period I was going through as well so your piece resonated with me a lot.  I keep the archive of outfits mainly to keep track of what I wore but also I hope to look back at it when I'm old and decrepit to see myself as a youth.	episode_done:True
text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - December 18, 2020	labels:Hey everyone,  &#x200B;  I'm 31 and have always been a jeans, band tee, and hoodie type person, but I recently started redoing my closet over the past few months.  I'm looking for some euro inspired trends.  I feel like I have a good base going.  I bought a couple of pairs of athletic slim black jeans - Lucky 410's, a pair of Adidas shell tops and stan smiths, a pink/lavender semi-casual button-down and a gray peacoat.  I like matching some of my darker sweaters with my black jeans and a pea coat.  I like that monochrome look with white, black and gray but I'm looking to branch out more.    This is the first time I'm really paying attention to my fashion and my wardrobe and I'm looking for some suggestions.  Right now, I like leaning towards more of a conservative or clean look, but I'm open to suggestions if this helps.	episode_done:True
text:Do you think fashion or style has age restrictions?	labels:I'm mid-30s and I still wear that stuff on weekends! There is definitely stuff I avoid, but honestly, reflecting on it right now, that might be more my personal style at play than my age. I avoid anything too tight or clubby, and I  tend to go for block heels or pumps over stilettos or platforms. There was a whole going-out-top-nice-jeans trend in the 2000s that makes me avoid anything satin- or lace-based. But I think that Vans/Converse or crop tops/high-waisted jeans are definitely still in play if you're 30. And if that changes soon, I'd guess it's because the trends change rather than what is appropriate age-wise!

I also tried to aim for the middle ground between ‚Äúcovered enough to wear to a conservative wedding‚Äù and ‚Äúnot so dowdy I feel 30 years older than I am‚Äù. A wrap dress to the knee ended fitting this bill for me!

text:What does your shoe wardrobe look like? What are your shoe essentials?	labels:I recently cataloged my wardrobe, and was shocked to find out I have over 30 pairs of shoes! 4 boots, 5 sandals, 8 flats, 6 heels, and 9 pairs of sneakers. The sneaker count is a bit inflated, though - I borrow my husband‚Äôs sneakers a lot (same shoe size, 10/10 recommend) and 4 of those are his. I have maybe 5 pairs listed on Poshmark right now, and could stand to get rid of a few more.   Despite the above, I swear I have about 10 pairs on my wish list right now. There are 2 pairs of boots, a pair of heels, and some flats that I have my eye on at present. I‚Äôd like a pair of shiny lace up boots, and to replace an old pair of snake print boots with green croc print. I‚Äôve also got a burning desire to own Mary Jane flats, so that‚Äôs on the list too.   I won‚Äôt list every pair I have, but the frequent fliers are:   Boots: dark red Docs; knee high suede and black Chelsea both from Stuart Weitzman    Flats: black & white Chanel ballerinas, black Gucci mules, red suede Stuart Weitzman d‚Äôorsay   Heels: Sam Edelman Barbie pink suede pumps, mid-heel Jil Sander black pumps   Sandals: vintage black patent ferragamo   Sneakers: white AF1 with a painted snake on the swoosh, my husband‚Äôs fendi monster eye runners & Gucci ace	episode_done:True

text:Does anyone have tips on how to find good stuff from Poshmark and other online thrift shopping platforms?	labels:I pretty much exclusively buy second hand/ thrifted clothes as I can get MUCH better quality clothing than if I were to buy new. I tend to buy off eBay, depop and vinted. I search for the brands I live pretty frequently (just the brand name, no other filters) then see newly listed items. I regularly pick up sezane, self-portrait, COS, Claudie Pierlot items at really low prices. It helps when people don't know the brand so well (Claudie Pierlot for example- just bought a perfect condition puffer jacket RRP ¬£350, currently on the outnet for ¬£169...I got it for ¬£15.) Or for example a brand new La Perla full length night dress for ¬£20.  I think it helps that I also sell a lot, so if an item isn't quite right I sell it on.	episode_done:True
text:Canada Goose Workers Allege Unsafe Working Conditions in Winnipeg Factories. ‚ÄúBefore I came to Canada I was in Qatar and then Dubai and it‚Äôs the same here in Canada Goose: No humanity.‚Äù	labels:In a culture that has generally turned on wearing fur for fashion, I dunno how this company gets a pass.

text:Guidance organizing a suit for my fianc√© for his father's funeral during lockdown	labels:So one thing to keep in mind is that, when your father passes away, most people aren't paying attention to what you wear. Many communities don't even expect a suit -- they just expect you not to wear anything too loud or disrespectful. But assuming he still wants a tailored jacket and pants.  6'5" is rather tall. I tend to say that height is not a clothing measurement, and it's not -- he might still find something off the rack... buuuuut it may be a lot of effort, especially if you can't get an arm measurement without a lot of effort. And I suppose it's not worthwhile to have him measured for a Made to Measure suit. So sure, just keep the gray jacket you have.  A gray jacket is... kind of easy and hard to pair at the same time. On one hand, it's neutral. On the other hand, you don't want to pair charcoal with black because it's usually low contrast; you don't want to pair it with other darkish grays, and you can't pair it with light grays for a funeral. You can't pair it with bright colors for a funeral. So you need navy blue trousers. That's the conservative, classic choice here... and it's fine.  100% wool is fine. Don't worry about an obvious mismatch -- you *want* an obvious mismatch, you don't want anybody to think he was trying to wear a suit but couldn't figure out how to match properly, you want people to look at him and know he is wearing separates on purpose.  A white shirt is your safest bet. A light blue shirt should usually also work, but might be a little more interesting than you want for a funeral. Get something sized by neck + arm measurements. Try Charles Tyrwhitt, they have a good variety of fits and do easy returns abroad. Charles Tyrwhitt shirts are 3/$100, don't pay a penny more.  A tie is probably still not necessary for a funeral, but if you want one anyway... well, what's your budget? There are brands that will sell you great extra-long ties.  Oh, and use a lint roller or garment brush to clean that jacket.	episode_done:True

text:General Discussion - November 13, 2020	labels:I‚Äôm start to get a hair across my ass about people getting obsessed with the ‚Äúquality‚Äù of potential purchases. Especially when it‚Äôs in regards to entry level brands.
text:I don't think it's going to go away. I think that's going to be the Millennial version of the Greatest Generation's relative pack rat and frugal mentality.   Two recessions in twelve years when we're in our 20s and 30s... if we're gonna spend money, it better be worth it.	labels:For me it's more the refusal to accept that a $100 leather jacket can only be so good, and that a $500 leather jacket can be objectively better in terms of quality.	episode_done:True

The jacket is noticeably colder in the sleeves than the body and I want to even them out.	episode_done:True
text:Having a Tough Time Finding Retailers for My Style	labels:So, look, I don't want to tell you _not_ to do this, but if I've understood correctly you're looking at creating a bloodborne-inspired victorian/traditional wardrobe. There are elements of that style that have mainstream appeal today, high-waisted wool trousers being one example. However, when you take them in context with the more "interesting" elements you picked out it gives off serious cosplay vibes. Perhaps you should take the fact that the only places offering this sort of clothing are Etsy/cosplay stores as a hint that you should reconsider this idea.  You might be thinking, _what about the cyber goth vampire Rick Owens fits I see on this sub?_ It's a valid question. The key difference is that the style you're going for here has _such_ a strong association with cosplay and videogames and so little mainstream appeal that the number one association people are going to make is that you are cosplaying. Doubly-so if you're wearing cosplay-quality clothes from cosplay vendors. While the Rick Owens aesthetic may not have mainstream appeal it _is_ very accepted within fashion circles and _doesn't_ have that strong cosplay association.  So with that said my advice is to take what you've got and tone it down. Treat it like a high-fashion runway show and take inspiration from it instead of trying to recreate it 1:1. High-waisted trousers, great. Gaiters? Maybe just get some actual boots. Bloodborne-style woolen collars/scarves/hooded shawls? Wear a regular scarf that has an interesting shape or texture, or a shirt with a more exaggerated collar. Maybe the fact that you can't find retailers selling this kind of stuff is the limitation you need to make it work in the real world.  Or maybe I'm just talking complete shite and someone smarter than me can help you more. I hope that I've at least broken the ice and said what needed to be said so that people can try to constructively help you.
text:I agree with you 100%. The sleeve thing, gaiters, and video game style collar things are a recipe for disaster. Maybe the aesthetic is possible to pull off, but it would require very high quality pieces and someone who is really good at this kind of thing. It's one of those, if you need to ask for advice, there is no way you could pull it off scenarios. As terrible as it is, I'd probably chuckle if I saw someone wearing any of those accessories at a bar or something. I'm just picturing someone alone at a dive drinking some shitty (or very oddly expensive for the bar) single malt whisky alone approaching random people and trying to talk about outdated philosophers. Even just the high rise pants look seems very intimidating to me. I'm always very impressed by the people on MFA who pull it off. It seems like one of those things where if you pull it off you look incredibly fashionable, but if you fuck it up just a little you end up looking  wholly ridiculous.	labels:And I won't know until I try it :) Have faith that I know what I'm doing
text:Also, post pics once you do.	labels:I will certainly do so!	episode_done:True
text:Are LBD‚Äôs really a MUST?	labels:I think it is a must as much as the trench or the white button down - it does not necessarily work for all of us, either our lifestyles or bodies.  Trench coats were invented when people wore hats, hence no hood, and they are IMO impractical for rain compared to hooded raincoats and can drown a lot of women's bodies particularly if they are not tall. Or if they bike, or whatever.   Little black dresses were probably a fantastic idea in the 60s, where women would dress formally for the office, or go to cocktail parties afterward. Right now I think the LBD probably is good for one thing, the specific cocktail or aperos or dunno a party given by your inlaws or something. I think it is something work having - but buy it cheap and/or in sale because likely you will not wear it lots... And focus on fitting (not too tight, not too short), if you find an affordable one which fits great and you have the budget/space, worth having. But do not go all check-list getting.	episode_done:True
text:what are wardrobe items you own that you absolutely recommend to everyone else here?	labels:Some random ones off the top of my head:  - Lightweight popover shirt. I‚Äôve got one in olive seersucker that I wear constantly in the summer. - A really good grey sweatshirt. Works as a mid layer in cold months or as the only thing over a pair of shorts in the summer and will be at home in a bunch of different styles. I like my Todd Snyder / champion one.  - Slim straight or straight dark wash or black jeans. As close to a ‚Äúmust own‚Äù piece of clothing as exists. - A good pair of boots. I like my RM Williams a lot at the moment, but something like a service boot or Chukka is equally useful. Great for all the situations ‚Äúin between‚Äù sneakers and something more formal.  - Long coat like a duffle or balmacaan. Cool way to standout when it seems like every dude in existence has transitioned to patagonia or other down jackets for winter casual outerwear.

text:Winter jackets that are good for skiing and casual use?	labels:Dont go crazy on a jacket.  The key for skiing is layers and you can get a lot of layers that work well in other settings.   A decent base layer:  you can go merino or if you are on a budget milsurp poly pro.  A fleece over that.  Next layer is a beefier jacket.  Right now I have a half zip Patagonia that is poly insulated.  Then get a waterproof(ish) layer.  You have a lot of options but I usually run with a marmot precip.  It's cheap, has pit zips and folds up way smaller than a hard shell. That combo will cover you skiing 90%of the time and let you adjust depending o N conditions. Flexibility is the key.  Take the money you save and get some good socks and gloves/mittens and some type of balaclava.  No one ever came off of the mountain because their chest was cold but it was their hands/feet/face.

text:DAE feel they made incredibly ODD fashion purchases, this year in 2020?	labels:I bought a lot of stuff this year, I won't be adding it up because that's always scary.  But everything I bought was bought for "next year me". For when I'm at a new job that involves being in an office all day, travelling through snow and sleet and rain and sunshine üòÑ Right now I'm working from home and my outfits are pajamas and slippers.  Also, there was a lot of comfort shopping too, this year has been brutal and painful. If some new boots can make me smile for a week, it's worth it.
text:I'm normally very frugal but this year gets a hard pass on spending. I only look at my CC statement to make sure I am not getting rooked on double charges and the like....but the total is hard to look at....and a lot of that is on things like shorts and shirts and things and I rode through the desert on a horse with no name...it felt good to be out of the rain.  Oof. I mean I can easily afford the spending but it feels weird.	labels:That comment made me snort out loud. Thanks!	episode_done:True
text:What are your favorite outfits to wear with white booties?	labels:I've had a pair for years. I usually wear them with a white skirt and pretty colored blouse or sweater, or with a lighter-color but long sleeve dress. I like not having to wear only dark colors when it's cold.  No white shoes after Labor Day hasn't been a rule in many decades. It's just trotted out as article fodder (to proclaim "These Rules Are Dead!") every so often.
text:How have you maintained them for years? I‚Äôve been looking for a cheapo pair since I don‚Äôt think white shoes of any kind would last me more than a season	labels:I don't wear them regularly; probably average of once a week in cool weather. Depends on the outfits I feel like. Periodically I rub off smudges and black marks with nail polish remover on a cotton ball - works like a charm on all white smooth-surface shoes I've ever owned. I find it easier than sneakers since the fabric is harder to clean off and not all fabric shoes wash well.

text:Sewing your own clothes	labels:Having basic sewing skills to repair or slightly modify existing clothes is a fundamental skill most people should have and is absolutely worth the time. Novice tailoring is a great skill to have too and can save you some money. Beyond that, sewing clothes from scratch is more of a hobby than a necessity for most people, due to the widely available nature of inexpensive and functional clothing. So like most hobbies, whether or not it is "worth the time" (and cost! Sewing is expensive and it's frequently cheaper to just buy an item unless you're looking for a custom fit or something super unique) is more dependent on your enjoyment of the activity than it is on more "functional" motivators like cost-savings.
text:I'm kind of at this level already. This is what saves you money. You can simply buy hand sewing needles and thread for simple repairs.   I'm also learning to make my own clothes, but that is definitely much more expensive than buying them. Your materials are generally of much higher quality and will probably last longer though.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Rick Owens Wearing Rick Owens	labels:I don't own a single piece of his clothing, and I probably never will, but one of the quotes attributed to him that really stuck with me when I first started browsing mfa was "No outfit is going to make you look or feel as good as having a fit body. Buy less clothing and go to the gym instead." He was right.

text:What I Like is Not What I choose to wear	labels:I get this so much. I have two boards on my Pinterest because of this.

The other board is eye candy	episode_done:True
text:Looking for aesthetically pleasing pajamas	labels:I will put in a rave review for Recliner pajamas. I now own way too many sets to mention, as I've been slowly replacing all my pj's with this brand.   I have the second skin nightgown which is a midi length nightdress that is super flattering, yes you could call it sexy (my husband does). I also love the PJ set long sleeve version.   Not silk, not gauze, but infinitely washable -- my very first purchase is 4 or 5 years old now and I've washed it every week and it still looks brand new, no piling, no stretching, no fading. It holds up to its claim and you can wear over and over again without getting stanky. I say this as someone who's been wearing this brand since I was perimenopausal and had hot flashes.   The second skin nightie is cut in a way that is super flattering--- but so are the Pj's which i am basically living in since COVID. I just sleep too hot so the PJ's are for day and the nightie is for night.  I did give the Lilly Silk Pj's a try but they don't stretch at all and just weren't as flattering or as comfortable.  I tried Lunya as well but I'm 5'0 and they were designed for very slim and tall people.	episode_done:True

text:What does your shoe wardrobe look like? What are your shoe essentials?	labels:FYI I work from home.  I also have smaller but wide feet so shoes are sometimes hard to find.  Going out is now a thing of the past (thanks Covid) and I won't feel safe at bars, etc until a vaccine comes around.  My essentials  (\* means seasonal)   1) Athletic shoes-- usually a name brand (Nike, New Balance, etc) purchased at TJ Maxx or the like.     2) Slip on sneakers-- surprisingly Walmart has some that fit well and are semi cute   3) Flip flops\*   4) Chelsea Boots-- The ones I have now are Primark brand\*   5) Knock off UGG velvet boots.  So comfy and I can't wait until the weather allows me to wear these again.\*   6) Tall riding boots\*   7) Winter boots that can survive the snow\*   8) Ballet flats   9) High heeled shoe.  &#x200B;  I have other shoes but for the most part I don't deviate too far from the above categories.  My offices have been shut down permanently so I don't have to worry about work dress from the bust down anymore.    As some of my shoes wear out, I do not replace that particular pair.	episode_done:True

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE!- October 26	labels:Hello, wondered what the community thinks about 3-piece suits for younger guys.  I am 20y and in need for a new suit, that I would wear semi regularly throughout the year. Need it for oral exams in uni, for a possible internship (law) and more formal events that would come up throughout the year.   Always loved the looks of a 3 piece suit and tend towards more formal clothing in general but really unsure if it is (age) appropriate.   Wouldn't normally care that much about other people's opinion. However I would wear it in occasions where (1st) Impressions do matter. Also considering that I rather spend a bit more on quality, I of course don't want to spend the money and then don't look good.  Worried that it would come of as a bit jarring, or just too much.   Any feedback would be much appreciated.
text:I can't necessarily speak to where you live, but in my 28 years of American life I've been to plenty of formal events and I've seen a 3-piece suit worn less than 5 times. It's definitely a more formal choice than a 2-piece suit and the general shift towards casual clothing means even the occasions for a 2-piece are getting rarer. So I would say that it will likely stand out and catch attention as an intentionally formal and possibly somewhat anachronistic choice.  That being said, I don't think it's inherently a *wrong* or *bad* choice - if you work in an area that requires very formal clothing, it could be useful to have the variety, or if you're aiming for that dandy-ish side of menswear that embraces the affectations, it could definitely have its place.	labels:I live in Austria, where things are bit more formal, at least compared to the US (from what I have seen). So more formal suit varations are not as rare but its still definitely the exception to the rule.   I would definitely expect it to stand out, at least somewhat. My main worry was, that it stand out for the wrong reasons.  I do have a shop near me that has a good selection of 3 piece suits. Just haven't been able to make an appointment due to covid. So actually seeing the suit on my body will hopefully help, in terms of getting a better picture.  Thank you very much, for your advice	episode_done:True
text:Adapting to age/workplace appropriate attire while staying true to yourself [discussion]	labels:There is nothing wrong with having 2 or more sets of clothes (work and not-work). I have to wear outdoor clothing for my "big girl job" - think wellies and raincoat or full on hiking gear - and a lot of jobs require a uniform. I also play a sport so i have kit for that. And I have a set of smarter clothes for the odd time I need them (weddings, funerals and interviews!) It's not unsustainable. You dont have to go minimalist or what you think is sophisticated if you don't want to.   As for age appropriate? When I was mid 20's I gave up (most) things that are for children and looked it because I felt I looked silly in them (I'm early 30s) but that was about it for age appropriateness. Other stuff I stopped wearing because my body and/or style changed rather than just ageing. Even the kiddie stuff, i dont think its necessarily silly/ageing on everyone. Some people really go all out on it and OTT and make it a look, and good for them. I did have a sudden panic late 20s that I needed to dress more adult, and wasted some money on things I never wore. But most of the pressure was coming from me and from magazine features. My friends, colleagues and partner DGAF.	episode_done:True
text:For those who actually MISS clothes/makeup/getting dressed up.	labels:I just still get dressed. Nobody is stopping me! My morning routine includes changing, and on "weekends" (days my SO is off work) I wear house dresses or leggings, but the rest of the time I put real outside clothes on. I still spend time trying out new outfits, to keep it fresh since I'm not buying much right now. I'd encourage you to try it out, even if you don't have plans to leave the house!

text:How do your clothes wear out?	labels:For me, it‚Äôs typically the elasticity of fabrics start to give and the items no longer fit correctly or if it‚Äôs a bottom, they no longer ‚Äústay up‚Äù. This usually happens with leggings or panties after about 5 or more years of regular wear with caring for the items properly.  I also had a faux leather jacket wear out after 6 years of regular wear. The faux leather ended up ‚Äúpeeling off‚Äù or something like that.
text:Thank you for bringing this up about leggings, it happens a lot now with my below natural waist yoga pants, especially in the back.  Now stores have high waisted pants in stock so I thought I had fixed the problem (me) but a lot of my yoga pants are 5-8 years old.  The inexpensive brushed leggings with an elastic waistband are all perfect.  I actually have one pair of Nike running pants from the 90‚Äôs and they are still good.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:What true heirloom pieces do you own and how do you incorporate them into your style?	labels:My heirlooms came from my grandmother, who was 5'2" in heels. I am built the same way, but have more inches than she did... so alas, that gorgeous Burberry trench coat simply cannot be made to fit.   However, Gram was a collector of cashmere and one of those people who believed that if you like a thing, you should have one in every color, and two in the colors you like best, against it wearing out. I have a handful of her sweaters, some of which are from the early 70's. These sweaters were everyday wear for her, and it does show, but they are SO soft and SO luscious that I wear them around the house on a regular basis. My cats don't care that they're two inches too short and have holes at the hem.   I did inherit some of her jewelry, including her engagement ring, which was put in a setting that my grandfather designed. Sadly, resizing the setting to fit me would have destroyed it, so I have that put away until I find a jeweler I trust to make it into a necklace with a new stone. I have an AMAZING opal bracelet of hers, also my grandfather's design, a silver wire cuff with the opals set in as the body of a spider. Gram never told my grandfather that the thought of a spider on her wrist freaked her out- she rarely wore it. I never met my grandfather to tell him how cool I think that piece is. Looks amazing peeking out from under the lace sleeves of my favorite LBD.
text:I love that you have so much of both of your grandparents in those pieces of jewelry! I bet you could pull of the chashmere with high waisted pants and holes aren't actually too hard to mend in wool if you don't mind thread showing a little!	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Does your language affect how you wear colors?	labels:Interesting question, but it further begs the question: what about bilingual or polyglots? Does language truly affect anyone in terms of color preferences?  And I don‚Äôt necessarily think language is a good measure for color because someone in SoCal will wear brighter colors than someone in Minnesota despite having the same language.  I think climate and culture play a bigger role because even countries with similar or the same languages don‚Äôt necessarily view color in a similar manner.  Edited to add: a better example of this would be French speaking countries (France vs Burkina Faso vs Haiti etc) or other countries that share a language
text:Language actually plays a huge roll in your development, but so do culture and climate.	labels:I never stated language doesn‚Äôt play a role in development. I simply stated that language doesn‚Äôt play as large a role in color preferences as OP thinks. There may be some, but I chalk it down to climate, culture, and, quite frankly, personal preferences.	episode_done:True

text:[Serious answers only] FAQ: Why does runway fashion looks like nothing you'd ordinarily wear on the daily?	labels:The best response I‚Äôve ever heard for this question was comparing runway high fashion to the concept cars you‚Äôll see at auto shows. Those cars will often never make it into production but that‚Äôs not the point. The point is to show off new materials, technologies, design philosophies or to generally stir up interest in a brand. Same for fashion.
text:But I feel like unlike runway fashion, concept cars are more appealing to the masses, even if they ultimately can't afford them.	labels:That‚Äôs why I like the comparison.   Clothes have a practical use. They keep you warm and dry and protect you from the elements. They also have a social use. The way you dress tells other people how you want to be interacted with. They also have an expressive use. Your orange jacket is your favorite color, the Metallica patch on your vest is there to remind you of the concert where you met your wife.  In the same way cars have a practical use. They are a conveyance to move people and things. They have a social use. A fancy new Mercedes or a well maintained classic jaguar e type tells others where you are in the hierarchy. They also have an expressive quality. Color, form, decals, tinted windows, spinner donk rims, etc.   And in both cases you‚Äôll see where there the style portion of the item needs to be balanced against the practical and social portions. A Lamborghini Aventador is dripping in style but you can‚Äôt move furniture with it. But it still functions as a car. You can still drive it on a public highway. It still has airbags and an engine and runs on pump gas.   High fashion, like concept cars, can be completely devoid of practicality. You can see clothes warped to the point where you question how the person even walks upright wearing their outfit. Sometimes they can‚Äôt. Concept cars can be so oddly proportioned that they cant fit an engine or drivetrain. Sometimes they don‚Äôt even have working doors on hinges. But that‚Äôs the point. It‚Äôs to turn the expression and social interaction values to maximum without having to compromise with practicality.	episode_done:True

text:Does anyone else not factor in pants when creating outfits? How to move away from this?	labels:Ease the transition with chinos, which still have the same sort of feel as jeans but are a step in the direction of "dressier" (please take that with the biggest grain of skepticism, it doesn't even feel right to type).  And then from there, straight-legged or skinny dress pants are just one more step.  I only tend to own my dress pants in black or navy blue, I think I have one single pair of a light grey checkered pattern but I have to be in some kind of mood to wear those.	episode_done:True

It was written in a different time, but it has a lot of great advice when it comes to ‚Äúelegance‚Äù and how to achieve it. It‚Äôs also quite funny!  For example: ‚ÄúTo be elegant is first of all to know oneself, and to know oneself well requires a certain amount of reflection and intelligence. Consequently, a woman who is utterly stupid will always find it extremely difficult to become truly elegant.‚Äù

text:What I Like is Not What I choose to wear	labels:What I like to look at and what I like to wear are not the same thing. I actually think a lot of fashion struggles come from people not understanding how to separate what they find aesthetically interesting from what meets the specific needs in their life.  When you look at a photo of an outfit, you're not *just* reacting to the outfit itself. You're also reacting to the body of the model, the styling choices (makeup and hair), and the photography decisions (the pose, the location, the lighting).   I might look at a photo and think "that person looks so cool in that outfit," but that person isn't me. I would not look that cool in that outfit because I'm a completely different person.  When I choose clothing for myself it needs to satisfy my aesthetic tastes when paired with my body and the amount of effort I'm willing to put into styling (i.e. zero), as well as suit the needs for my daily life. That's actually a limited number of options for me.   But when I am admiring an outfit or a photo, I'm not constrained by my hang ups about my body or the needs of my daily life. I can just like the outfit without having to contextualize it around myself, which is actually quite nice.  So, personally speaking, my interest in fashion isn't limited to clothing I would choose to wear. I find it's much more freeing to allow myself to enjoy fashion and outfits without always questioning whether I would like the outfit on my own body.
text:I love this comment. It‚Äôs so freeing to appreciate fashion (and fashion photography) as an art and not only from a consumer perspective or through the lens of your own wardrobe needs. I have tons of Pinterest boards for aesthetics that are totally impractical for me, but I just enjoy looking at them and imagining the lifestyle of those characters. I only have a couple of boards that are for items I would practically wear. Those boards have purpose too, but I have a definite mental distinction between looking at outfits for fun and trying to fill holes in my wardrobe.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:MFA Brand MegaReview: Zara | January 30, 2021	labels:2012 through about 2014 I was out of college, unemployed for stretches, underemployed for others, and underpaid for the rest. After being unemployed post-college in 2012 and living with my parents, and then my entire annual income in 2013 was about $13,000 while I was living on my own, and somewhere around $20,000 in 2014. I had some freelance gigs here and there where I could pull in $500 or $1000 bucks outside my reported income, but I was ostensibly "living in poverty" for a few years.  Zara was honestly kind of a godsend in that period, I needed somewhat fashionable clothing but had basically no money to spend on it. I work in the contemporary art world and dressing well is literally part of my job. While Zara isn't exactly highly respected, I was able to get some decent looking clothing on the cheap.  Today I find it easy to criticize Zara, whether it's the stolen designs, or the fast fashion model, or the inconsistent sizing, the sweatshop labor, and so on, but I admit that for a moment in my life they were a really useful utility. When I didn't have money for clothes but I needed decent looking clothes, Zara was one of the best options available to me. There's a lot of better options in the world if you have time and money, as I do now, but I'd be a hypocrite to ignore the benefit they provided me when I had neither time nor money.  Also while they're not exactly a "buy it for life" brand, their clothes didn't fall apart on me either, so, I'll give them props for that. Everything lasted an appropriate amount of time for the price.
text:Bruh wut ? Nothing against Zara not coming to complain but I always found Zara to be expensive side and lesser quality ? For the same amount of money I'll spend it at Uniqlo lol. Basically I was doing the same thing as you bit with uniqlo haha	labels:	episode_done:True

text:General Discussion - November 30, 2020	labels:<rant>  If I said "Wear cropped jackets so you look taller" I'd be laughed out of the room but somehow "Short people shouldn't wear long coats" is a valid thing?   Also what's defined as short? If someone is 5'7" do they get to wear long coats? What if they're 5'7.5"??  It also throws the idea out the window of the whole horizontal breaks thing that people complain about for cropped trousers or high-waisted pants. Suddenly you have a wonderful garment type that can give you long, **tall**, and elegant lines and it's impossible to wear.   People complain all the damn time about menswear being too "restrictive" and women's wear being more "exciting" but everyone is too much of a wimp to wear a ~ L O N G C O A T ~.  I fucking hate fashion "rules" and "guidelines" and literally everything having to do with the word "flattering". If you care so much about these gender norms, masculinity and being ~ flattering ~ then sack up and wear the clothes you like.   That whole thread is just people saying that someone else told them they couldn't *wear a coat* so what should they do? Oh idk. How about tell them to fuck off and wear the damn coat.  </rant>

text:Shinies From the Past - or, What to do with Gifts from Past Relationships?	labels:Depends on what it is. Engagement ring? Probably not gonna be able to wear that, might as well sell it or have it reset into a different piece.   One of my exes is the son of a jeweler and I got some extremely nice pieces in the 5 years we were together. There is no way I would have parted with any of it (unlikely to buy pieces at this price point for myself) but I did return the engagement ring since it was his mother's diamond. Everything else is still in rotation.
text:That's very interesting! One of the pieces I'm struggling with is, in fact, a ring, although not an engagement ring. Did you find you had a hard time detaching the relationship from the pieces you did keep, or not so much?	labels:I didn‚Äôt ever really feel weird about it because it was all stuff I really really liked. I did get rid of the one piece I wasn‚Äôt thrilled about (a watch, I don‚Äôt wear them and he didn‚Äôt listen - shockingly part of why we‚Äôre not together!) but kept the ones that I could see myself wearing. It took me a bit to wear any of it after the breakup but I told myself the relationship was what sucked, not the jewelry. üòÇ
text:Ha, I love it! I really like 2 pieces in particular but think it's gonna take a bit to wear it, as you say. I never really wear a lot of jewellery, especially now that we can't go anywhere, so it still feels very connected to those few times I did wear them which of course was with the ex lol.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What are the pros and cons of dressing the way that you do?	labels:Well, I'm a lesbian with long hair and traditionally feminine clothes.   Pro: People assume I'm straight. This means I don't get the constant judgment that comes with looking visibly queer (unlike my fianc√©e, who we joke is a "50 footer" because you can tell she's a lesbian from 50 feet away). I work in healthcare and live in a politically mixed area, and everyone is automatically friendly to me.   Con: People assume I'm straight. So if I mention my fianc√©e people assume she's male, and if her pronouns come up I have to have this whole awkward interaction where (at best) they go "Oh--she??? Ohhhhh" and then look me up and down, awkwardly change the subject or ask me invasive questions, and stop being so friendly with me. Also, men hit on me, and women never hit on me.
text:I feel this to a degree. When I was a teen, I dressed super goth/punk but hadn‚Äôt come to terms with my sexuality yet. In high school, I got hit on by all the out lesbians and had to constantly explain I was straight. I didn‚Äôt figure out I was bi with, like, a super strong leaning towards women until I got to college and my style was very college boho/stoner/art student at a liberal arts college (peasant skirts every day!) My hair was down to my bra line and all the ladies stopped hitting on me.   I kept telling myself after every date with a guy that my next relationship was finally going to be a woman, but only guys ever seemed to hit on me :(   I‚Äôm still not sure how I should have dressed in 2005 to attract the ladies but it definitely wasn‚Äôt what I was doing.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:what are wardrobe items you own that you absolutely recommend to everyone else here?	labels:Custom made dress shirts - I got 4 made a few years ago and I literally never reach for my off the rack ones unless I have to. Worth every penny.  Ralph Lauren Slim fit OCBD - I find these the perfect balance between small collar uniqlo ones and old school baggy Brooks Brothers  Black bit loafers - the one dress shoe to go with if you don‚Äôt have to wear suits all the time.  Technically too casual for suits but it‚Äôs 2021 and no one cares, plus you can wear them with jeans with more casual outfits and get a whole lot more for your buck. I like Gucci but all brands make these at every budget.   One pair of black, and one pair of dark blue slim jeans  A nice wristwatch - I‚Äôm partial to a vintage Omega, vintage Rolex Datejust or a modern Panerai depending on your style that will go with everything and where you can mix and match different straps  Lululemon ABC Joggers - live in them when I don‚Äôt have to dress up, and they still don‚Äôt look sloppy  Uniqlo Merino sweaters - so cheap and does the job as a mid layer  Abercrombie sweatshirts - no logo options fit me great and are super cozy. I regret paying so much for John Elliot ones I have now  Suede biker or trucker jacket - that‚Äôs the one piece I go to when I want to look a bit ‚Äúextra‚Äù and it always does the job  Denim shirt - go to casual piece to throw on a tshirt. I think Levi‚Äôs are cheap and fantastic   LBM blazers - great modern slim fit blazers with casual textures, fits perfect and you never look like you wore your suit jacket. Incredible value on sale for how much I wear them	episode_done:True
text:How do you find your true style when you're surrounded by fast fashion?	labels:i found my style basically by getting pinterest.  when you get pinterest, there are either two ways you can find outfit inspiration that you like. the first way (which someone already mentioned) is looking up movies, tv shows, singers etc. that have a style that you genuinely like and then create a board for fashion. the other way is to just search for different styles (i can give you a whole list of styles to search up if you want). after that, your pinterest will start recommending you more things to you.  some examples of things i would personally look up are "beabadoobee outfits", "euphoria outfits", "the craft style"  finding brands is probably the hardest part for me be size the style that i like isn't as common, but if your style is a bit more out there, you should find small businessesm i especially like instagram for that. i actually found some that i like from some photographers that i follow. as well as that, i also knew some from influencers, including heaven by marc jacobs and unif.  edit: also second hand apps are very good for clothes. depop is where i get most of my second hand stuff but ebay can occasionally have very good things for pretty cheap!! once i found authentic prada jeans on there for $45, gucci pants for $15 and more.	episode_done:True
text:advice on how to stop buying clothes I don't need?	labels:Stick it in your cart then close the tab. Come back to it if you‚Äôre still thinking about it a few days later. Lots of things I‚Äôve wanted I end up not getting once I put some time between finding it and actually buying it.

text:What is your favorite clothing purchase of the year, and why?	labels:I bought a Seiko Flightmaster SNA-411 watch early in the Summer and have been really enjoying it. It's very different from other watches I have, busy-looking dial, but fun to look at.   In case watches don't count as clothes, my second favorite is a Barbour Sapper jacket, which I found in the Spring at a very good price. I've gotten a lot of use out of it. It's warm and dry, good pockets, and looks nice.	episode_done:True
text:Have you ever participated in a clothing swap - in person or online?	labels:Pre-Covid, I went to several clothing swaps hosted by a friend of a friend. The clothing swap would be at a bar in the area, you could get drinks (friend of friend is a bar tender) and go through the clothing on the tables. You could choose to drop off clothes and take nothing, you could choose to give away nothing and take stuff and anything else in-between. Most people came with stuff and left with different items. Everything left over at the end of the night was donated.   I LOVED going to these swaps. I got so many awesome things and it was a great way to give away things that I was no longer interested in wearing.
text:I've been to usually smaller swaps where everyone had to bring something to take, and bigger swaps where you you didnt have to.  I'm usually almost more grateful for the opportunity to get rid of stuff constructively than I am for taking stuff, though the taking is the fun part.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Casual Fridays - What do you like to wear?	labels:I haven't worked in a proper business casual place in a long time. My office is casual and I tend to dress up.   As mentioned, it depends on what level of casual is implied. I always took it as sort of one casual element, and the rest is regular business.   So I feel like you can do a couple of angles.   One of my favorite angles is a fancy version of something casual. E.g. a jogger in a trouser fabric or a shirt dress shape in a nicer fabric (like a wool knit, or some sort of jersey knit or silk. Or a shirt dress but with sheen.   The other angle is one casual element with a dressy outfit. E.g. nice dress with fancy sneakers. Or jeans with a blouse, blazer,  and "nice shoes."  Or maybe a sheath dress with a moto or jean jacket.   My default work outfit is usually a dress, and I feel like depending on the shape it could either go casual or dressy. And it jut ends up being a lot easier for me. I have dresses that are a bit more casual and ones that are a bit more fancy. The fancy ones get a casual piece and the casual ones get a fancy piece.	episode_done:True

text:Thanks bro!	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Does anyone else have this style issue?	labels:I definitely feel this. I have a large butt/hips and do often find that they impact the shape of silhouettes that I'm trying to wear. I'm very inspired by menswear as well and dress fairly androgynously. I tend to modify menswear silhouettes slightly so that I can achieve something similar. I personally feel much better in high waisted pants with a tucked in shirt/sweater - somehow I feel like it emphasizes my lower body less and gives me a sleeker line from top to bottom, so when I'm drawing influence from menswear I tend to modify it with a higher waistline. I also make sure that I'm defining my upper body with tops that are more structured around the shoulder. Drop shoulders don't play well with me.  I find with these tweaks I'm able to both find a nice balance where I don't feel like I'm fighting against my body and I'm also able to invoke more masculine references and play with most silhouettes I like. Although it did take me a lot of trial and error to figure out it out.	episode_done:True

text:Lugged boot trend	labels:I adore platform chunky shoes. My late 90's early 2000's teenage self is VERY onboard for this. The boots might be a bit much for me- I'd love to be cool enough for Doc Marten Jadons but I can't imagine where I'd wear them. I can't even think of the last time I've been somewhere where I'd just look cool and not like I'm trying too hard.   My forte, however, is flat form sneakers. I had a pair of Sketchers Whompers that I got on clearance for $1 at a Marshalls when I was in HS. The world had moved on to those 3 inch platform flip flops by then, but I wore the absolute shit out of those Whompers.   I won a credit on Poshmark and ordered some checkerboard platform vans that I've coveted for years. Booyah.

text:Advice needed: How to keep up with trends without social media?	labels:Your best bet is going old school and following blogs. Set up an RSS feed, find people you like, and follow fashion that way.   But this is also a good time for you to explore YOUR personal style, without the influence of... uh... influencers. Obviously some of the fun of fashion is finding out what the trends are as dictated by other people, but with a little freedom from those, you might create silhouettes and combinations that are far more interesting to you personally than whatever's popping off on IG this week.  You can also do what I do and set up an IG that's just for this kind of thing. I don't follow anyone I know, I don't post anything on there. It's just for me to keep up with fashion, some bands I like, and a few owls managed to sneak their way in there. If you set up something like that, you can set aside an hour on the weekend and get caught up on fashion stuff without even installing the app on your phone. A lot of influencers are on YouTube too, so if you'd prefer to stay away from IG altogether, you can just look for their YouTube pages and watch their content on the weekend.

text:The finances of curating a high-end wardrobe through luxury resale: how much do you spend on clothing taking into account resale revenue?	labels:Clothes are never ever an investment. With the extremely few exceptions like Birkins and limited edition Chanel bags or stuff like that, it's not a thing.   Clothes will not retain their value and it's naive to think that you can buy something and expect to recoup more than half your money after *5 years* of wearing it. Especially since it's probably already a few years old when you buy it.  Pret a porter does not do as well as bags on the resale market. No one gives a shit that your old cardigan is designer because in another 5 years it will not only be worn out, it will be really outdated. If someone is paying hundreds for one single item, they're not buying worn from a collection 10 years ago AND still be willing to pay half the original price.

text:Been there. Not fun.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:How do comfort vs. style compare in what bottoms you wear?	labels:I mostly wear jeans/pants and I find them to be very comfortable personally. I'm honestly always a little surprised that they're so uncomfortable for most people. Most of my discomfort in skirts/dresses is mental (I just don't feel like me when I wear them).   I think if you enjoy wearing skirts you should keep wearing them, nothing wrong with that. If it's a seasonal thing maybe fleece stockings or something like that will allow you to wear them in the cooler months.
text:I have found people overwhelmingly wear clothes a size too small (like speaking to friends and whatnot). My sister, for example, buys the same size leggings as I do despite her hips and waist being 5-6 inches larger than mine, and then complains about them being see through. I have strong suspicions that this is the reason people find thongs horrifically uncomfortable as well.	labels:I have slim hips but a wider waist, so I have to pick a smaller size for mid-waist then for high-waisted. Slimmer hips also comes with a bit of belly pouch, even at size 6-8.  Most bottoms are cut for wider, but flatter hips then my round ones, so sizing pants up rarely works if it get's larger in the wrong places.  Tight, high-waisted jeans doesn't work at all for me, since they try to force my lower torso into another shape, and usually leads to stomach ache.	episode_done:True

text:My Wardrobe Post: Based on what I currently have, what should I wear with what? And an essay reflecting on learning to dress better.	labels:Christ you‚Äôre gorgeous and you‚Äôve really put a lot of thought into this.  I looked at your albums (HS til work, and the wardrobe) and perhaps I might‚Äôve missed it but I think you‚Äôd look great with a plain tee + button up (tucked in, unbuttoned 1/3 ~ halfway). Maybe roll your sleeves up too?  I also really liked the sweater + collared (I assume a button up) outfit, but I guess the Texas weather ain‚Äôt great for that‚Äîbut I‚Äôd love to see you in smart casual. I‚Äôm curious how‚Äôd you look like with glasses in these types of outfit‚Äîit‚Äôll lean towards the nerdy side if that‚Äôs your thing. I also think a plain white button up for work would be nice‚Äîalthough it‚Äôs common and boring if you wear it right it‚Äôll look great.  Try cardigans? I only skimmed through your future purchase so if you were planning on getting it, oops.  And the Adam Driver resemblance is uncanny‚ÄîI can‚Äôt tell if I prefer you with long hair. You look great in both the work/WAYWT length hairs.  Korean men fashion is somewhat similar to the Japanese fashion style but I think there‚Äôs more so if you wanna look into that too.   I know very little about men‚Äôs shoes but I think finding more (semi) formal (?) options (leather... etc;) would benefit your outfit in the long run.  I can‚Äôt wait to see where you go with all of this!	episode_done:True

If there's a certain type of item your looking for, feel free to ask for recommendations and I can send you a link to what I'd look at.
text:Thanks for sharing!   Items I'm looking for:  \- White sneakers - preferably leather   \- Jeans - Slim/skinny light blue, navy, black   \- Jackets - from bomber jackets to other non-bomber kinds  \- Sweaters or sweatshirts I can layer under my jacket  \- Long sleeve shirts/henleys  \- boots   If you've come across any of these on amazon that you think may be decent purchase I'd love to check it out	labels:Amazon has pretty decent t-shirts and sweatshirts (not knit sweaters!) that you can get for a good price. You can also buy some decent quality sneakers from Amazon too, just make sure it's from a reputable seller and from a recognized shoe brand (Adidas/New Balance/etc.).  &#x200B;  However, for stuff like jeans, jackets, boots, and knitwear, I'd look elsewhere. I've bought jeans from Amazon in the past that came with low-quality buttons and ripped after 2 months of wear, so I don't think the quality is quite there. My recommendation would be to search on places like Uniqlo/Carhartt/Champion or even thrift stores to get better quality jeans/jackets/knitwear that can last you a lot longer than whatever you'd find on Amazon for a comparable price.
text:Thank you for sharing! I appreciate the insight!	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What are your thoughts on outfit repeating multiple days in a row?	labels:I don‚Äôt do it consecutively because it‚Äôs too eye catching and people conclude all sorts of things (incl. you spent the night elsewhere and never returned home) and also I find it a bit boring to wear the same thing two days in a row when I have an audience of people observing my dress. But I will like wear the same outfit later in the week absolutely, or mix say a Monday pant into a Thursday outfit or a Tuesday top into a Friday outfit. My work ‚Äúcapsule‚Äù wardrobe is very limited because I wanted to have nice things for my job but not buy too many things.  On the weekends, I‚Äôve been known to wear the same outfit Saturday and Sunday for sure but I don‚Äôt typically see the same people/go to the same places on both days  I think most people innately crave identity and variety especially if fashion is something that they enjoy. Not everyone need be that way though, and I encourage you to do whatever works best for you, even if you buy 5 of the same outfit and wear it exclusively all week, every week - that can be a look and a statement too	episode_done:True

text:What was your "how in the name of all that is holy did this end up in a thrift store" find?	labels:It‚Äôs less about the value of the item and more about the stars aligning perfectly.  I wear a size 12-13W shoe, plus other things that make my feet really hard to fit, so I am used to buying formalwear to match the one maybe two pairs of formal shoes I own at any given time.  So when I was 17 and going to prom in 2006, my mom tried really hard to help me find shoes, any shoes, that were suitable. But we could only find casual flats or runners, and I realllly wanted to dress up nicely for the first real time in my life. So she said ‚Äúyou know what, let‚Äôs buy a dress and then we will just have to find a way.‚Äù  So I picked out a black and pale pink dress that just made me swoon, and I figured black heels would be easiest to find. Lol I was so young and stupid.  Anyway we searched high and low right up until the week of prom, we drove to the US from Canada and looked there and I still couldn‚Äôt find a pair of heels that fit enough to buy and I decided I‚Äôd just wear uncomfy like always and deal with it.   Then I randomly walked into a thrift store and saw on the shoe rack a pair of pink heels in the exact shade of pink on my dress, with black trim. Picked them up, size 12W. They fit like they were made for me.   Wore them until they broke three years ago.

text:Model poses while online shopping	labels:They do that when the fit if the garment is inferior. It is intentional.  Beware items that have this kind of photography, because most of the time it means the garment has bad construction, weird seam placement, or unfortunate details.  Well constructed items are not shot in this manner. Brands want to show off their excellent construction. It is known.  Hope that helps!
text:I notice this the most with Asos, when there are like 4-5 pics of the model hunched, or with their arms crossed, or with their back to us hailing a cab. Asos does sometimes have a short video clip so you can watch how the garment moves, which is slightly helpful.   &#x200B;  Zara has their weird pose things and you have to compare it to the pic of the garment laid flat (which they usually include).   &#x200B;  It's shitty because you literally have a basic understanding of garment construction, where seams are lining up on the model, your own body type and shape, and do a mental algorithim that looks like that guy from It's Always Sunny at the wall with the conspiracy strings to figure out if a dress will fit you.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Guys who lost a lot of weight, how did you change your style?	labels:I definitely changed my wardrobe up when I lost weight.

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - January 06, 2021	labels:Slippers for wide, sweaty feet?  I've been rocking a set of Glerups scuffs around the house for two years, and especially heavily since March. My wife has been non-stop complaining about tiny bits of felt that wear away from the inside, ending up all over the house... and now I've worn a small hole through near my pinky toe on my wider foot, so it's time to give them up. I'm tempted to just get another pair and deal with my wife's complaints about errant felt bits, but despite their excellent moisture management, I'm still a bit sweaty in them after a while. So, I'm on the hunt for a new pair.  I live in Florida so it's rarely ever cold indoors, the tile flooring notwithstanding. And I have very wide feet (9EEE/EEEE.) I like scuffs because I can just step into them without using my hands, but I'm open to alternatives. I've always wanted to be able to rock leather mocs, but going by even my comfiest leather shoes, I'll get far too sweaty, far too quickly, unless I'm wearing good socks... which defeats the purpose.  Any suggestions? I was thinking a set of boiled wool instead of wool felt might work better. I do have some boiled wool Haflinger slippers and I like them overall, though their construction leaves much to be desired for the price - the badly-designed seams are barely holding together, the glue is starting to separate, and the PVA footbed is prone to both sweating and stinking.	episode_done:True
text:How do you find your true style when you're surrounded by fast fashion?	labels:For me it came with age. In my teens and early 20s I wore the same sorts of things my friends did. By my mid 20s, a lot of my style was influenced by bloggers (just before the social media influencer era, when fashion blogs were at their peak).   But I eventually got used to spotting what looked good on me, what didn‚Äôt, what I actually liked the most and what suited my lifestyle.   I‚Äôm 30 in a few weeks and I don‚Äôt follow current trends. I wear the things that work for me.	episode_done:True

text:Tucking in shirts	labels:When I was younger I probably thought it was too dorky. These days I care less and I also realize that it helps me look more proportional by visually shortening my torso and lengthening my legs, so I'd much rather do that. In many cases it's more flattering for me (and maybe for you) because it cinches in my waist a little. I'm short, so it can be tricky to look proportional.  For button-down shirts I normally tuck the front, like a french tuck. Tucking it in all around is usually too formal for me.	episode_done:True
text:20 Sweaters for Less Than $150, So You Can Achieve Peak Coziness - Esquire.com	labels:In my experience, sweaters are one of the few garments where there's a noticeable increase in quality as you spend more money.  Cheaper sweaters are noticeably thinner (both the threads and the sweater itself), which don't keep you as warm and don't last as long.   The good news is that there are some great options for getting high quality sweaters at low prices if you're willing to shop secondhand. For $150 you can find a gently used sweaters from Ines Meain and IMO that's a much better purchase than most of the cotton and fine merino wool sweaters listed in this article.

text:Cyberpunks Not Dead - Inspo Album	labels:Digging this! I just finished a month-long cyberpunk roleplay/cosplay/lifestyle and the elements that I was looking for in my fashion choices were sharp edges, black or neon, things that light up, face coverings or face paint to confuse facial recognition software, straps, heavy black eye makeup, bright hair, metallics (although that's just because I have metallics-- I think iridescence is more on-brand). We modified it to tie in some vaporwave/outrun aesthetic as well, so pastel pinks were on the table as well as anything that looks glitchy. I'm loving seeing the overlap and non-overlap between the looks we went with and this album!   Favorite cyber-looks are the wide-brim hat with the blue veil, the Calvin Lou look with the spiked hair, the Emporio Armani look with the black translucent fabric and the tiny 90s shades, the Each Other "free hugs" photo, and the Rocostru silver straps.  I love the veil because I think facial masking is a part of what I imagine a cyberpunk future to be about and I think the color scheme is right on-point. The Calvin Lou and Emporio Armani looks both just nail a Matrix-era vibe to me. I love the way both looks play with showing skin and I love the hair styling for both... both read very cyberpunk to me. The Each other look is great partly because I love turning the storm trooper "free hugs" guy into a nostalgic cyber-icon but mostly because the 3D glasses are super on-brand-- both colorful and technological-- and the outfit is also super functional. And, loving the silver straps in general.  I wish I'd had the idea and courage to go more nipple-forward in my costuming for last month... digging that part of this album and loving the implication that our future is more down with women's nipples.

text:Is anyone dressing up this year for Halloween?	labels:I usually go to my local goth club on Halloween, dress up ridiculously and dance all night. That is absolutely not happening this year, so I have opted to dress up ridiculously and drink for free at home.    2020 has been a complete wash as a year, but I haven't put on makeup or heels in 8 or 9 months. I'm hoping dusting off my vanity will cheer me up at least a little.

I have several wool/fur dress coats and a couple parkas. I‚Äôve over indulged in coats the last several years so my carts are empty, though I‚Äôve been eying a dark green wool coat for over a year...
text:I'm debating getting a dark green coat as well! I've wanted one already years ago, but was convinced by others to choose a dark red instead...  Still lusting over a dark green, but now I'm not sure whether I should get a wool coat (cheaper but only 1-1.5 months a year they are warm enough but not too warm) or down coat (hardly any dark green ones available üôÑ).

The really cheap brands (e.g. F21, Fashion Nova - this was before SheIn) did NOT work well for me - the low-quality was obvious in the fit and drape of the fabric, plus it was pretty difficult to find office-friendly pieces in the first place.  H&M and the Banana Republic/J Crew Factory Outlets (they're online!) were a lifeline, and I still wear many items!

It‚Äôs been a few years since I purchased some from there since I don‚Äôt currently need any (plus they all all seem to be high-waisted nowadays) so I don‚Äôt know if the fabric makeup is the same or not, but I‚Äôd give them a try. I also like some of their joggers. In case you need any athletic leggings, Under Armor has been comfortable for me. Just the basic cold gear or heat gear though. The higher rated ones (2.0 and up) have a thicker inner layer which I did not care for on my skin. Too much of a ‚Äúsnag and drag‚Äù type sensation if I had any dryer patches of skin.	episode_done:True

text:Does anyone have any visual guides for how clothes should fit	labels:Geidre Kavaliunaite on Youtube makes some great videos about styling.

text:Do you have a concept of "Par Value" in menswear?	labels:From a logical perspective, it makes a lot of sense and this system would work for most people. I think everyone naturally has a different idea of what "on par" means to them given their budget and taste and there's a saying that the value of a piece is what the buyer is willing to pay for it. Sometimes there will be those pieces that just speak to you regardless of the price and while those are a rarity, I would like to see that incorporated into this system. This is more true when you start going up the scale where fashion becomes more of an art form instead of "clothes". For me, I would pay $1000 for a Craig Green jacket because I love his work and it speaks to me on a deeper level like a '97 Honda NSX would; to me the experience is worth the money. While the numbers are important, to match your golf analogy, it's still a game to have fun.
text:Absolutely this. While quality is something I think about, especially when going into the triple or quadruple digit price range, it isn‚Äôt always my guiding factor. Plain black tee? Yeah sure I‚Äôm going for par quality. I‚Äôve never understood people who need a Margiela plain black tee. But I do understand people who want Margiela tabi boots. I‚Äôm sure you can get boots that out quality Margielas for half the price. But they won‚Äôt ignite that flame and if I‚Äôm not ignited by a statement piece them I‚Äôm not having fun.   I guess this whole discussion will just be people fighting for *how* and *why* they dress. Some people want solid brown boots to last 20 years. Others want boots that make them feel a certain way or say a certain specific fashion statement. Regardless we‚Äôre all one fashion fam. :)	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Hand wash only clothes	labels:So far I've done pretty well just putting my things in mesh laundry bags and washing them on the delicate cycle in the machine, then air drying them.  That being said, we have a machine that was chosen specifically because it had a very good delicate cycle, and most of my pieces weren't terribly expensive to begin with. The tag may say hand wash only, but I'm not too worried about polyester.  For things I really really love and for my bras, I do actually hand wash them, and I'd probably do the same if I were to make a really expensive purchase or if I were handling an extra delicate fabric.	episode_done:True
text:Covid Dilemna - Finding my style	labels:I got to do some of this in store, and honestly that was a lot easier. But when the stores closed, I ordered stuff online and tried it on at home. I ordered from Zalando, which has a ton of different brands and free returns. Trying clothes at home was pretty nice, because I could take it in for as long as I wanted, get back to some stuff on a different day and pair the new clothes with my own to see if it made a good outfit.   When you're just starting out though, it's important to actually try out a lot of different things. Don't focus on clothes you might want to buy, just get some plain things with different necklines, fits and materials to see what looks good and what doesn't.  Once you have narrowed that down, you can look for more interesting stuff that actually fits your style. So if you do this by ordering online, make sure returns are easy.   If ordering online is not an option, maybe you can borrow some clothes somewhere? Shirts, dresses and skirts also can be pinned to change their shape. And if you have old clothes you don't wear anymore you could cut them into a different fit. Things like cutting a crew neck shirt into a V-neck or a maxi dress into a midi or mini, or shortening sleeves. If you're handy with photoshop or something, you could even try that.
text:These are really great ideas. Not sure I'm comfortable cutting clothes. Everytime I've tried to DIY an outfit, it come out horrible lol. The advice about finding simple outfits with different necklines is super helpful though.

I mean, I certainly tease my buddy when he drops $2k on a computer monitor but that's purely because I like giving him shit, not that there's anything inherently wrong with the purchase.

text:Does your language affect how you wear colors?	labels:This is called the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis or linguistic relativity in linguistics and is widely rejected by modern (post-WWII) linguists. There's simply not any evidence to support that our language strongly affects our perception.
text:I came here to say this! Having words vs not having words for something doesn‚Äôt change whether or not you can see that colour lol. Language does change how you construct your worldview (eg whether you think of time as linear vs circular is often rooted in how you talk about time) but not so wholly as to affect colour.   I think more so than language, culture and location would have a huge impact on the colours you wear. I grew up in a hugely colourful country and all levels of formality allow colourful clothes, but now I live in Canada and everyone wears black and blue and grey year-round, especially in winter, even casually. As another commenter said, someone living in Alaska will likely dress in different colours vs someone in Cayman despite both speaking English.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Cold weather friendly skirts and dresses	labels:I also hate wearing pants. Don‚Äôt know how cold we‚Äôre talking but up to around  40 F, I would pretty much wear any autumn-y skirt/dress and rely on my wool tights, knee high leather boots, and a long wool coat to provide warmth for my lower body. Personally, most of the skirts I chose to wear were 100% cotton denim, leather, or suede!
text:I like a mid-calf wool skirt that has plenty of folds, a wide hem, and a satin lining. The shape allows freedom of movement and room for other layers, and the smooth lining defeats friction so the hem doesn‚Äôt bunch up.

text:General Discussion - January 15, 2021	labels:Am I the only one that doesn't see how the Teddy jacket would give off peaked in high school lettermen jacket vibes like all the lurkers that were clearly bullied by jocks are claiming?  Obviously it's inspired by letterman jackets, but removing the contrasting leather sleeves and not having a TGI Friday's wall's worth of shit stitched onto it completely changes the vibe. I don't know, maybe I just associate it more with rockstar because it's an SLP piece and Alex Turner was the first celebrity I saw a photo of wearing it.

The fabric was thin, the cuts and seams were weird as hell, sleeves were short, and more. It was obvious that it was just a "straight from crappy manufacturer" product with lies on the website. What's unfortunate is that I had a feeling prior to ordering it that it wasn't going to be good.

I don‚Äôt own any bold colour shoes, but if I did and were to say wear a red shoe, I might try to wear something else red in my outfit to tie it in, like a shirt or a bag.

I‚Äôve also got broad shoulders due to lifting and a naturally muscular build while also being slim, but I‚Äôm also only 4‚Äô11, so I have to shop in petites.  Most petites are first of all still not short enough for someone under 5 feet (like, why is 5‚Äô4 considered petite?), and second are cut narrower, which is the opposite of what I need.  I typically end up with pants with stretch so it fits at my waist while also fitting around my thighs and sweaters/tops that are a size or two too big for my stomach so that my shoulders don‚Äôt look ridiculous.	episode_done:True
text:What are a few items that you feel are essential when planning a wardrobe?	labels:IT depends on you.  What is your lifestyle (be realistic)?  When determining this, keep your area's climate in mind as well as your workplace (or school) dress code.  Also know your hobbies because a hiker is going to need vastly different attire than someone who likes clubbing.  IF your work environment is casual, then you don't need a closet full of business formal clothing.  If your workplace requires a uniform, then you don't need a wardrobe full of work clothes (unless the uniform is a dress code like black pants/white shirt).    If you're living in Miami, then you likely don't need a down parka.    That said, no matter your lifestyle, I'd have one outfit in your closet (could be the same thing or separates) to wear to a job interview, wedding (guest, not wedding party), and funeral.  Be prepared ahead of time should those occasions arise.    My other recommendation to learn color theory and the color seasons.   If you are unsure, try and find a celebrity that has similar coloring to you and study their wardrobe and what colors they wear on red carpets.  Know what colors look good on you and which ones do not.   I'm a clear winter, so my colors are jewel tones, icy pastels, and crisp colors.  Muted tones like olive, khaki, mustard, off white, etc look terrible on me.	episode_done:True

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - January 10, 2021	labels:Can you guys help me find a versatile suit that will serve me for interviews and also be acceptable at weddings/funerals? After years of cobbling together formal/business attire at the last minute (which doesn't look great), I want to have a go-to suit I can rely on.  I'm thinking dark gray or charcoal since I don't have a black suit for funerals. I've been looking at Suitsupply and Spier & Mackay. Neither have a storefront in my town, but I could drive 1.5 hours to get to a Suitsupply store though I'd rather not. I'd heard some good things about the J Crew Factory Thompson, as well, but I wonder if that's still a good deal.  Does anyone have recommendations for specific suits, rather than just a retailer? I have an uncommon body type. I'm 6'3 and 168 pounds. Most of that length is in my limbs. I usually look for medium tall shirts to fit my chest and sleeves.  Chest: 37"  Sleeve: 35.5"   I found different advice for measuring sleeve length. I used this method:  >ARM LENGTH: Bend your elbow 90 degrees and place your hand on your hip. Hold the tape at the center back of your neck. With a friend's help, measure across your shoulder to your elbow, and down to your wrist. The total length in inches is your sleeve length.  Thanks in advance

text:A discussion about ‚Äúknockoff culture‚Äù	labels:Hot take: nothing is really original anymore, and most everything has been done before or inspired by someone or something else. For the luxury brand to automatically claim ownership simply because it's *designer* is bullshit imo.  We all know that quality differences will be present. A $3k coat isn't going to be on the same level as a $100 one. If someone wants to spend the extra money, cool. If someone likes the look but wants polyester instead and can only spend a lot less, cool. If the designer coat is really that great, there will be a market for it. If tons of people are buying the knockoff and no one is springing for the expensive version... Well, maybe you misjudged your market or overpriced your item.  I don't have a problem with knockoffs because they appeal to different crowds. Not everyone can afford a multi-thousand dollar handbag. Why should a struggling single mom who likes the design of something be relegated to a plain black bag? If she finds a similar style at Kohl's, she should be allowed to buy and enjoy it. I feel holding designer items as being superior, and then looking down on knockoffs, is classist. End of.

I also started caring about what I wear and planning my outfits. Velvet shoes, corduroy overalls, rainbow prints, sequins, bold colors. Who cares? I've been called out for dressing "fancy" before, but I've stopped giving a shit in correlation with my confidence in my abilities. I'm a teacher...if anything, I'm showing the students it's okay to be yourself and take risks.

text:How has lockdown affected new purchases?	labels:Lots more free time and boredom has meant way more time spent looking at and buying clothes.

text:Article: Why Is Fashion So Beige This Season?	labels:The last time I remember noticing beige getting popular was around 2009 (the great recession). I was going to fashion school at the time and one of my profs noted that neutrals tend to come in style when the economy tanks because the pieces are more versatile. Like, there's only so many ways you can wear a bright pink top, but you can generally wear neutrals with everything.  Anyhow, I've noticed color palettes are trending more neutral again and I took it as a sign that fashion folks are taking into account that during the pandemic customers are trying to stretch their buys as far as possible.  Tbh, I don't feel strongly about it except that what I think it signifies makes me sad. I think it's triggering some minor trauma from my early adulthood and the recession ü§£

text:> on the flip side, why do bowls of pho or hand-pulled noodles cost severely less?  Same reason why, in popular culture, food from France, Italy, etc. continue to be considered atop the hierarchy of global food while food from India, China, Thailand, African countries, etc. are not.   Not that that's the only reason, but it is one of them.  >why does a plate of carbonara cost $20 in LA and NY?  You'll also have to consider that restaurant pricing in places like LA and NYC will just be higher on average, in addition to the dumb prestige-premium associated with ordering "French food" and "Italian food."	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Does your language affect how you wear colors?	labels:I read an article in scientific American forever ago that discussed the way some languages are structured to center the group or the space rather than the individual speaker the way English does, which can contribute massively to how a culture's values are learned (individual gratification vs acting on behalf of the group, consuming/hoarding natural resources vs conserving/cultivating them). In my amateur  assessment, I'd say language effects our fashion choices more in the realm of what we're dressing to communicate (personal wealth, individual perspective and creativity, respect for the natural environment, etc), and in the realm of how we consume fashion (desiring to have more or better than others in our community, desiring newness, desiring to leave a smaller environmental footprint, etc).	episode_done:True

text:You know how audiophiles all make jokes about how meaningless the terms used to describe sound are because sound is so hard to define in that way? Same thing here, ‚Äúwarm‚Äù and ‚Äúcold‚Äù are very loose terms that probably mean something a little different to everyone.   I can see the argument for grey and cream being cold, brown can be warm or cold depending on the shade, not sure if I‚Äôd agree with black.	labels:Now *that's* an argument I understand. Although I still think the way he's communicating is strange. I think he means tonally neutral, bland, desaturated colors. "Cold" is a really strange way to say that, whether or not the term is technically ambiguous.
text:>I think he means tonally neutral, bland, desaturated colors  I would argue that‚Äôs what cold means, while blue is generally cold, I don‚Äôt think cold means ‚Äúmore blue‚Äù, it‚Äôs more about the relative saturation and intensity of the color, basically you have to judge what makes a certain color warm or cold totally in comparison to other similar shades, not as a general sliding scale of ‚Äúbrown is warm, blue is cold, always‚Äù, though, like I said this is all a semi useable way of describing it.  Going back to the audio examples, I always see vinyl described as sounding ‚Äúwarmer‚Äù than digital, when I first heard albums I knew on vinyl my first reaction was ‚Äúwow that sounds really different‚Äù, immediately followed by ‚Äúwow, I _definitely_ wouldn‚Äôt describe that as warmer‚Äù, so, I do get the confusion	labels:Kelvin scale?	episode_done:True

But it's honestly pretty hard to match all of your leather and metal items perfectly. I often have items in varying shades. Is it a big faux pas to mix leather colors or is it not a big deal? (E.g. natural colored leather accessories while wearing dark brown leather shoes)
text:Matching  metals is not a thing,  except in men‚Äôs tailoring where you match your belt buckle, to your cufflinks, to your tiebar. It doesn‚Äôt apply to jewelry or watches both of which come in two-tone varieties,  making it impossible to match in those circumstances.   Matching leather is a little more nuanced.  With men‚Äôs tailoring you should match your shoes and belt pretty close. Same with the upper levels of business casual say blazer and/or tie. It also doesn‚Äôt apply to watch straps or accessories  Anything below that level, getting it approximate is close enough. I like to match brown to  brown but don‚Äôt worry about the shade all that much.  if I‚Äôm wearing oxblood shoes I wear a brown belt.

text:How do I know I‚Äôm not being scammed?	labels:These are all pretty much dropshipping the same cheap clothes from Ali. Unfortunately affordable and ethical usually mutually exclusive because our idea of what cheap clothes should cost is based off a fast fashion model that can't work at a smaller sustainable scale. I would highly suggest the used market for affordable ethical clothes. threadup and poshmark are my go tos. But if you want to buy new Universal standard and Pact are good.

text:I love the idea of this, although really good custom tailoring as they describe in the article is not exactly easy to come by.

Givenchy Mini Antigona in smooth leather (looks so edgy and bought this for the practicality aspect, as it can hold more items) 2. Gucci Dionysus Super Mini in black leather (can barely fit my phone in there, really is just for the aesthetic lol) 3. Prada Brushed Leather Shoulder Bag with Flap in white (my more casual everyday bag) 4. Dior Medium Lady D-Lite in Blue Cannage Embroidered Velvet (probably the sexiest bag I‚Äôve ever seen) 5. Small Lady Dior (when I‚Äôm feeling a bit fancier)  I‚Äôm thinking of adding a Louis Vuitton backpack to my collection for days when I want everything out the way on my front and just need my hands free and also a Dior Saddle Bag. All of these bags just bring me a sense of pride ever since I started gaining interest in high fashion items. Even though I could easily buy it with my parents‚Äô money, I busted my butt working as a barista to pay for these items, and I cherish each and every one of them. It‚Äôs even more special that I worked so hard and put in so many hours to be able to purchase them, which means so much more to me than having every luxury bag on the market. If that were the case, they wouldn‚Äôt be special anymore and wouldn‚Äôt hold the same value to me.

text:Justin Guitar is probably the most popular starting point for learning to play guitar online. If you want a more personal experience I'm sure some teachers in your area that might be doing zoom lessons.  Semi-serious rec for sports, Rocket League e-sports league has a couple of tournaments over the next few weeks. It's really easy to follow and pretty fun to watch, and also the game itself went free to play recently and is pretty addicting.	labels:I‚Äôll check out Justin guitar and if it doesn‚Äôt work I‚Äôll look locally! Thanks!   I dig rocket league! Played a good amount from 2016-2017. I‚Äôll check the league out thanks :)	episode_done:True
text:Negative Self-Talk re: Fashion Choices	labels:I don't think there's anything wrong with preferring dresses and leggings and it doesn't inherently signify that you are somehow unworthy for pants or "letting yourself go".   The thing is, historically speaking, dresses were actually far more practical for a woman's body due the cyclical changes we all experience, from menstrual bloating/cramping, to minor weight fluctuations, to pregnancy and breastfeeding (historically there wasn't much choice about the last two but obviously now there is), cuz you could cinch up or let out your dress depending on how you were doing.   It's only now that stretchy fabric is truly mainstream that pants have truly become as practical and cost effective in that they can tolerate a lot more cyclical size changes, which are *normal*.  Edit: not to mention all the times people would gain and lose weight due to the availability of food.   I'd say I have a pretty confident mindset and 90% of my non work wardrobe is dresses and skirts/shirt combos. I wear undersummers in the spring and summer, leggings and sweater tights in the winter and I've gotten SO MUCH MORE USE out of my dresses... They lasted me up until my 8th month of pregnancy, I barely had to buy maternity clothes.  I have been able to wear the same knit dress/leggings combo at 180lbs prepregnancy and later at 210 lbs post partum and still look cute.  What pair of pants could pull that off? Almost none, I tell you.  Saved me a lot of $$$.   No matter what I weigh, I always have a bit of a belly, so most pants dig into that anyways, which isn't comfortable. Only truly high waisted stuff feels ok, but I don't want to wear that in the summer.   It sounds like disordered thinking is creeping up on you, and you may have to consciously remind yourself that there's nothing wrong with enjoying comfy clothes that don't restrict your abdomen.

text:Article: Why Is Fashion So Beige This Season?	labels:The last time I remember noticing beige getting popular was around 2009 (the great recession). I was going to fashion school at the time and one of my profs noted that neutrals tend to come in style when the economy tanks because the pieces are more versatile. Like, there's only so many ways you can wear a bright pink top, but you can generally wear neutrals with everything.  Anyhow, I've noticed color palettes are trending more neutral again and I took it as a sign that fashion folks are taking into account that during the pandemic customers are trying to stretch their buys as far as possible.  Tbh, I don't feel strongly about it except that what I think it signifies makes me sad. I think it's triggering some minor trauma from my early adulthood and the recession ü§£
text:I think that‚Äôs true, although I‚Äôve noticed the beige color palette all over home decor too.  I associate it with a certain SoCal aesthetic.	labels:Complete the look with gold wire accessories and household objects made of gray concrete.

text:The Conscious and Somber Decision of Solid Jacketing	labels:I also love solid colored jackets, but for a different reason. I try to only have two patterned pieces on my chest because I find it the most visually pleasing, and I love patterned shirts and ties so that only leaves room for a solid jacket.
text:I like that mentality! I think I approach that in my essay, specifically with checked shirts + repps or striped shirts + paisleys.  Those combinations *only* work with a solid jacket IMO.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Scene / Emo / Goth fashion in 2020	labels:Aside from graphic tees (which I've learned to make on my own now, but its a money sink unless you can find buyers to supplment it) almost everything I and my friends did in our youths were DIY. We added our own studs, spikes, zippers, straps, belts, etc. Obviously adding a pocket would require a little extra but it was possible and within a few tries you'd be golden. Adding patches, fabric strips and other misc. items and using fabric inks went a long way. One of our friends even started fabricating her own jeans.  We were into punk fashion though, so not sure how much of this advice applies to what you're looking for.  The best way to get what you want is to make it. Though there are some elaborate apparel items (like a victorian-inspired goth coat) that would be better off buying... but DIY will be a LOT cheaper and produce exactly what you want if you're capable.
text:Thank you, i actually need to do some DIY but vie been a little lazy and with the holidays i don't think ill be doing it any time soon.. I haven't found a good place to buy cool patches yet other than Esty, do you know any good places to find them?	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Two things I see: higher quality replicas (watch world experiencing the same thing) and more people carrying the ‚Äúentry‚Äù level bags from certain brands. There‚Äôs definitely tiers of quality/price even within a single brand like LV.	labels:And I think the tiered model can be a slippery slope, look where Michael Kors is with most of their items - even though they have (or had until recently, have not caught up with the brand) high-end items.	episode_done:True
text:How do some people put outfits together so effortlessly. Fashionista's please help.	labels:Hi! Former stylist.  1) Pay attention to the fit of things and figure out what cuts and shapes look good on you. Paper bag pants and some joggers have similar fits. Some mini skirts and shorts hit the same place on your legs and can have the same waist height. Find your sweet spot and don‚Äôt be afraid to buy multiple things in silhouettes that work for you.   2) Get some statement pieces that you would die for. If you are wearing a pair of jeans that fit well and a t-shit purchased within the past 3 years with some awesome earrings you going to look and feel great. If you are wearing an amazing dress and simple white sneakers you are going to look and feel great. Don‚Äôt overthink things but try and wear at LEAST one piece you are excited about at a time.   3) Don‚Äôt buy things just cause they are on sale, you saw your friend wearing it, or you feel like you ‚Äúneed‚Äù something in your wardrobe. You should love everything in your closet in its own special way unless it‚Äôs workwear and you hate your dress code for work. Something as simple as a T-shirt has so many different factors like cut, material, neckline, sleeve length. Purchase what feels good and don‚Äôt bother with the rest.
text:This is a perfect list, I would also add that you should not be afraid to break out of any style rules that you have. One thing I do when making myself break a random ‚Äúrule‚Äù I made up for myself is to buy a realistic version (a color/fabric/style I already like/own) and wear the new/weird thing somewhere easy. I just forced myself to buy and wear a kimono top/jacket this way. It was a matching set and I had already bought the pants and had worn them, but didn‚Äôt buy the top because I just don‚Äôt wear kimonos.   So I bought the kimono top and wore the outfit to my sister‚Äôs house first for just a regular hang out, and then I wore it ‚Äúpublicly.‚Äù (It‚Äôs not really public rn but I wore it to see someone in my non-fam bubble LOL.) After wearing it around at my sister‚Äôs house I felt comfortable in it and it no longer felt like a weird thing to wear.   This doesn‚Äôt always work, sometimes I just won‚Äôt like something, but if I‚Äôm drawn to it and the only reason I‚Äôm not getting it is because of some internal rule I made up, it usually works.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Other than the conventional black/blue/white pants or trousers, what other colour pants or trousers do you own ? How do you style it ?	labels:While my wardrobe is fast turning as black as my soul, I‚Äôve enjoyed two pairs of colorful pants: a pair of mustard cords, and a pair of salmon boyfriend chinos, both from Gap. I‚Äôm glad colorful pants exist! I‚Äôm heartbroken the mustard cords didn‚Äôt hold their color for more than a few years‚Äînow they‚Äôre just an odd yellow shade, like Charlotte Perkins Gilman picked out the shade‚Äîbut in their prime I loved wearing them with Weejuns or midcalf boots, a chambray or blue plaid shirt or a lace cap-sleeve and denim jacket, a chunky necklace. Granted, this was the early/mid 2010s. I styled the salmon chinos about the same. Now, if I were to choose a pair, I‚Äôd go for a jewel-toned pair, perhaps Eileen Fisher lantern pants in that gorgeous red color, and pair with black. I‚Äôd pair a high-contrast pant with a high-contrast/clear top, and muted pants with a muted top.	episode_done:True

As for those vs an obsidian band, it depends on the occasion. Assuming a typical office job (obv these won't fly in trades), at work an obsidian band would look much better because that's not the environment to wear something as bold as the things in this album.

I look like a very well dressed mad woman and it's awesome.  Outlandish and soulless are not the same thing. To. Me honestly they're opposite ends of the spectrum. What feels truly soulless to me is trying so hard to appeal to someone else in that you lose a sense of self.  Be bizarre and outlandish. Just do it for the right reasons. Wear your witch hat and make petticoats cool again. Fashion is not the enemy. Small wardrobes and neutrals are not the holy grail. Finding out that some people try to cheat and buy their way to an image doesn't matter. You can still make it awesome.  Now I'm off to try and find somewhere to wear my purple satin kimono with cream and gold brocade trim to.

For example, if  Person A wanted to be perceived as confident, they would ask themselves if the article of clothing or whatever fit inside the "confident" bubble.  I found that idea to be useful. So the first step is choosing your keywords, and then considering them when you shop or dress yourself.

text:How do ya'll express your culture or traditional fashion in modern clothing?	labels:My ethnicity is...half white American, half white English.

The world gets so much more rich and interesting and dynamic when people can feel comfortable wearing more of the clothing from their cultural traditions. I love this movement. Just wish I could contribute more to it than compliments and supportive grins whenever I see non-western clothing being represented!
text:What is your culture‚Äôs traditional clothing ?	labels:Well I was being a bit tongue-in-cheek of course, but the basics...jeans. Shirts. Tees. Sneakers. Three-piece-suits. You know - "Generic westernized clothing." That's an interesting question to really think about though.  We've got to take the history WAAYYY back to find anything with a strong regional tradition that's anywhere comparable to, say, cheongsam or salwar kameez, if there even is any to be found. I can't think of much that has really truly stuck around and stayed unique or symbolic to either region.  The cultural symbolism and weight just isn't quite there with most of this stuff. Victorian ballgowns aren't exactly a "cultural tradition," for example, because they were symbolic not of an entire cultural history but of a place and time, though they are uniquely British creations. Not exactly ceremonial or something one would "put on to honor your culture." Flapper dresses, maybe? American Hippie attire? White wedding dresses? Graphic tees? Neckties? All may have started in the US/UK (or been appropriated by them!), but look at where they went. *Everywhere*. That's what happens when you're from a colonizing powerhouse.	episode_done:True

Does anyone have any stylish but functional suggestions? For the time being I've been unhinging my jaw like a snake and fitting everything down my gullet till I need it, but space is limited and I'd like to be able to carry a few more essentials.

text:General Discussion - October 20	labels:Working from home has been a struggle. Started doing it in March when everything shut down and it was ok (kept to routine of showering, putting on "office clothes" to feel like I'm going to work, etc). Now all I do is roll out of bed about 10 minutes before I start, make coffee and sit my ass on the chair and work the whole day.   Even my clothing purchases have all been tshirts and sweatshirts. I can't even remember the last time I bought a button down dress shirt.
text:Morning shave, nighttime showers.    I'm still doing office clothes, but my office clothes have always been pretty easy going.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Fashion to help your changing body and lifestyle?	labels:Not really answering the question, but my issue has been the opposite. I'm about 10lbs lighter now than I was in high school, and I've stayed short and tiny my whole life. I basically kept my high school wardrobe all through college, then packed it with me when my husband and I got married and I moved. I didn't see the issue and thought it was ludicrous to get rid of an entire closet of clothes that were still intact and fit me well, until I started getting more serious about my career as a professor and realized my "professional teaching clothes" still read as "student attending an award ceremony."  Starting over the summer, I began weeding through my closet and donating anything that didn't make me happy or I couldn't imagine myself wearing in front of a classroom of college students or colleagues (except for my loungewear and workout clothes.) I felt A LOT of guilt at first, because I realized how many pieces I held onto for the nostalgia or just because they fit. I had to invite one of my closest friends over to help me make the tough decisions and she didn't let me talk myself into keeping a piece I initially put in the donate pile. That really helped my perspective, and now I can make more objective decisions without needing a cheerleader.   Once I got rid of about half of my closet (spring/summer and fall/winter wardrobe combined,) I gave myself permission to buy a few higher-end pieces that are much more my style but also fit both my daily life and professional needs. Neutral colors and versatile silhouettes. I feel so much less stress and guilt when I open my closet now, it really feels like I've moved into a new chapter of myself. It's my dream to have a 10-15 piece capsule closet, but one step at a time.  I'm so sorry I just went on a big tangent. It's been an enlightening quarantine for me obviously lol.	episode_done:True
text:‚ÄúSadd‚Äù Colors: 1620s Puritans to 2021	labels:Any idea what colors the Puritan colonies would have even had access to make locally?   I'm wondering if the association with more garish colors related in their minds to foreign trade and is maybe more about how they feel towards external cultures.
text:I think their dislike for garish colors began in England, before they began building a colony in MA Bay. Most of their dyes would have been vegetable and plant dyes.  They definitely had an air of superiority and settler colonialism to the way they dressed, and they even disliked the fancy colors preferred by the more Anglican Virginia elite.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:I actually hate my Ruggable. I love the design, but it is horrible for a house with dogs that shed a lot. The only way I‚Äôve found to get hair out of the rug is to get down and scrape it with my hands. Since using the vacuum with the brush (which would normally loosen hair) separates it from the Velcro and causes it to wrinkle, it‚Äôs impossible. Also, the edges are always rolling up.

My most essential item for work is a pair of shoes that are comfortable, easy to walk in, and stylish- I go for mules currently, but in years past, I was very into ballerina flats or pointy-toed plats and even had a stint with loving Tieks.   A pair of black skinny jeans has been a staple in my wardrobe for almost a decade now, so those are probably an essential for me also- although I've been getting more into straight and wide leg denim now.	episode_done:True

text:What are novelty leather keyrings/keychains for? How do you use them?	labels:I believe that they are used so you can have an easier time finding your keys as well as just a decoration.   I don't personally use them because I like to minimize the amount of space my items take up, but I can imagine it being relatively hard to find keys in a large tote unless you have a lot of little thingos hanging off of them, or you attach them to some kind of long string, hook, etc or keep them on a lanyard like you said.	episode_done:True
text:How do you balance bright statement pieces with a capsule wardrobe?	labels:I think jewelry and/or accessories can be a good idea for your loud/bold statement pieces.

text:Buying vs selling on resell websites	labels:I bought/sold on Poshmark when it was starting to get popular, and found great deals and sold pretty easily on it. I stopped a year later - by that time, I had started seeing wholesale distributers flooding the site and making it alot harder for me to find actual used clothing for decent prices. I'd agree that there are likely too many sellers now compared to buyers - or at least too much merchandise compared to buyers. To me, that makes Poshmark too much like Ebay, and is no longer as distinct a platform as it used to be.  Edit: typos
text:I've got some great deals as a buyer and now I'm dipping into selling, just to get rid of some old stuff without having to dump it at a thrift store where I know it will probably be thrown away.   The wholesalers have ruined the site, I feel like it's impossible to discover new brands, since if you don't type in a specific brand the results are almost all shitty wholesalers selling crap.   Ha there is wayyyy too much merchandise on both of those sites, I might never have to buy new clothing ever again!

text:Woah that 10ply is insane. Please let me know how you like it! im tempted to save for one.	labels:I received it todat. Damnnn, it is SOFT. I would say it is probably close to cashmere in term of softness and how smooth it is. The knit is tight, and dense. It isnt as weighty as inverallan or so but i started to sweat 15 seconds after putting it on. I am on the bigger side of size small so size S fit slim on me. Up one of your usual size if you want a relaxed fit. The color is very hard to capture, i even thought the green look brown looking at the website but it is more green in real life than on picture, especially under the sun.

text:People who built your wardrobe consciously from scratch - what were your strategies?	labels:I had to start over once. Basically, I graduated college in 2008, during the recession. I was poor, and being paid for shit. As I found better pay, I also immediately had 2 kids, so I was a million different sizes, with lots of bills. As a result, my wardrobe was ill-fitting cheap stuff. It was a mish-mash of styles and sizes. Most was from Goodwill and other thrifts/garage sales, Old Navy, Forever 21, etc. My casual wardrobe was basically stained sweatpants that I never left the house in. Everything was purchased solely on it's cheapness, and my work clothes didn't have to "fit", they just had to pass as office attire. It sucked, and I didn't feel great about myself.  Once my husband and I finally changed jobs enough to get to a good place financially, and my kids got old enough that a lot of the baby bills subsided, I finally had the money to fix my clothes. Before I started, I lost about 40 pounds to be back where I wanted to be. I then went to the stores and tried on A TON of stuff to find out what looked good on me and what I liked. I only bought things that served a purpose for me, and I ruthlessly purged things that didn't. I also stopped buying from "fast fashion" places, and I mindfully thrifted/bought only quality pieces from quality brands.   It honestly took a couple of years, but I think I'm finally done. I actually don't own that many clothes, because I get rid of anything that isn't being used often enough. I find that having one good, black dress that fits me serves me far better than having 10 ill-fitting, cheaper dresses. It's my only formal dress, and I have used it for pretty much all weddings and funerals. It's comfortable, it looks great on me, and I change the look with my shoes, bag, and jewelry. My wardrobe is built around workhorses like that that cover many occasions and that I want to reach for because of how good they make me feel.	episode_done:True
text:What's been your experience with men's stores/departments?	labels:I usually don‚Äôt experience any negativity when shopping in the men‚Äôs dept. Go after what you‚Äôre into and don‚Äôt worry about the employees anyway! One thing I will say is for pants or shorts, in my experience, it‚Äôs better to buy masculine styled clothes fit for women. Then you avoid the weird men‚Äôs fitting and bulge.
text:Agreed. My son is FTM and finds most men‚Äôs pants to be problematic because his hips aren‚Äôt straight. He does a lot of elastic waists and athletic wear. You‚Äôre probably better off with bottom items designed for women. As for the employees...I wouldn‚Äôt worry.

text:What is something you've heard as fashion advice that isn't worth following?	labels:Probably the advice that anything I wear as a fat person has to be slimming or flattering. Yes I wear a lot of black, but just because it's easy not because it makes me look thinner. My size isn't a big secret or anything.   Also this is taking a really broad view but the fashion culture of planned obsolescence, declaring certain things "out" and other things "in," is super classist and unsustainable, so even though I enjoy reading about new trends I don't really care to follow them.
text:I agree with you, as I aged and had other responsibilities I realised I did not care to follow trends.  Though I enjoy following fashion and learning what is going on. It is interesting to look at it as an expression of culture, social and public mood, technology advances, and as an artistic expression.  It's also interesting to see how fashion percolate (the famous Devil Wears Prada scene on the jumper).  On that same note, as fashion changes, it is difficult not to follow it. Trends come into most clothes we buy no matter what we trie to do.	labels:>Trends come into most clothes we buy no matter what we trie to do.  Exactly. And it's also really difficult to predict what will culturally "stick" as a more longterm trend that may even end up being a "classic." I remember when skinny jeans were becoming a thing and people decried they they'd be a passing trend, when they've gone really strong only until very recently (and even though they're no longer super fashionable, they're still a common "basic" at this point.)   I was recently watching an old episode of "What Not To Wear" and Clinton was aghast at the trend of people wearing white sneakers/trainers to the grocery store and anywhere other than the gym. That reaction seems so weird now that athleisure has become so ubiquitous.

Even if you are more comfortable in sweats than you are in PJs, we can compromise with athletic wear, but they have to be clean and fit correctly.   Now, in high school, she‚Äôs gone more towards skater/alt kid, which means she steals my clothes and shoes.	episode_done:True

Fast forward to now and I finally feel secure enough to wear whatever and speak however I like. I *LOVE* having Asian motifs on my clothes - my closet is full of crane and koi fish details. I'm also lucky enough to be working in a sector that fully embraces diversity on a deep level. Can't wait to try some of these brands out!

text:Does change in climate = change in style?	labels:When I moved from a very seasonal American city to South East Asia, I for whatever reason thought that I _needed_ to live solely in very thin, very loose cottons and breezy skirts. I didn't bring a single pair of jeans or boots because I was fairly certain they would cause me to immediately melt into a puddle. For a period of time, I prioritized the heat over everything, so my style became really plain and blah, whereas I used to be fairly experimental back in the US.  Luckily, I then realized the key to dressing in the heat is just finding a balance. A thin turtleneck is fine with a skirt. Jeans and boots work fine with a tank top. Light weight blazer or loose oversized button-ups have replaced coats and sweaters, but still allow for some layering.   I've come to a good place with what I view my style as now, but I find that I do have to repeat a lot of basic "outfit formulas" and feel a bit envious of people who live in the cold and can layer to their hearts content. I think the cold weather lends itself to more creative combinations, whereas being stuck in perpetual summer makes me feel confined to a life of sun dresses.	episode_done:True
text:Cotton Candy Femme Fatale: A Cassie (Promising Young Woman) inspo album	labels:I love this! Personally, I love to dress *majority* of the time in what I would have to call, ‚Äúneutral academia‚Äù which is edging closer to, ‚Äúdark academia‚Äù but with softer neutrals and occasional splashes of pink. This tends to be seen as professional, so it‚Äôs my work go-to. The closest reference I have is from the Chinese drama Meteor Garden, the newer one (2018?), I was amazed to see the Hua Ze Lei and I dress almost identical. A lot of that style section of my wardrobe is from Abercrombie, Little Lace, Reformation, and Nordstrom.   On the days I‚Äôm feeling playful, I dress more, ‚Äúgirly grunge‚Äù where I mix distressed jeans, with baby tees or crop tops and layer on a sweater or open cardigan. That section of my wardrobe is typically from Tilly‚Äôs, WildFox, Free People, Patagonia, or PacSun.   The days I feel moody/sexy remind me of the edgy part of your posts. I don‚Äôt wear black often so when I do I‚Äôm sultry about it. I love wearing Doc Martens or Paladins with distressed black skinny jeans and mesh tops, or a edgy graphic tee/sweater, or I wear fitted black dresses with any combination of shoes. I‚Äôm also really into wearing lingerie bodysuits with outfits‚Äîit‚Äôs feminine in the bedroom but reads as edgy once you step outside your house. That section of my wardrobe is typically from Ruckus, Dolls Kill, Gooseberry, Intimissimi, or Nasty Gal.   I incorporate hard details with accessories. A soft outfit can be topped off with a dark brown or black wool hat. I‚Äôm always wearing my All Saints goat head necklace, shortened to be almost a choker, and when I eventually replace that I‚Äôll be looking on Etsy for a new one. It‚Äôs so dainty that it looks sweet until you *really* look. I also tend to carry a black purse no matter what the outfit. Plaid, gingham, and houndstooth also feel (to me) to work well together when making an edgy/soft combination look.   Such a great post, and good luck cultivating your dream wardrobe; you‚Äôre going to look amazing!	episode_done:True

I don't even differentiate between morning and evening makeup I'd wear red lip at 8 AM.	episode_done:True
text:Does anyone else have this style issue?	labels:I feel this. In my case I think the problem stems from me getting pieces that I like aesthetically but that have something wrong with them that I ignored/didn‚Äôt realize until later. For instance I got these shorts that looked really cute but got really wrinkly around the crotch after I‚Äôd sat down, and then they just looked like a monstrosity. Like my entire outfit was completely overshadowed by my goddamn crotch haha. I ended up donating them because I realized that even though they were a style I liked and a great color, the fabric was not right for me. Getting a good pair of khakis that flatter your curves will go a long way. Get them tailored if there is something wrong with the fit on an otherwise good pair of pants. Just look for that holy grail pair that fits you nicely, and don‚Äôt buy stuff that is *almost* good enough but has a problem (unless it‚Äôs a problem tailoring can fix).	episode_done:True

text:General Discussion - January 19, 2021	labels:I never thought I'd become this person, but man, shipping costs really can fuck up my desire to buy something. I was just about to commit to buying another pair of sneakers and it's probably the best deal I'm going to find on them, added to cart, shipping info entered, billing info entered... $20 for the cheapest shipping option. No shipping codes available, no threshold I can cross to get free shipping. $20 period, no exceptions.  It's a $300 pair of sneakers discounted to $180, I guess should be able to rationalize that at $200 (including shipping), I'm still getting a better deal than what's available anywhere else online (only a few select retailers got this colorway, and all but one are sold out in my size), but still, $20 shipping feels *wrong*. My brain has been trained from years of online shopping that there should always be some way to get around paying for shipping, or otherwise, shipping should be cheap.
text:I think it‚Äôs only in the last couple years that expecting free shipping has become common in Canada, due to Amazon. It‚Äôs definitely damaging to smaller retailers that have to eat the cost or lose customers.   OTOH, it‚Äôs wild how much in fees people will justify to use a food delivery app rather than pick up. Like probably as much as that $20 shipping!	labels:	episode_done:True

Luxury is so secretive about their supply chain and manufacturing that you cannot really get a good sense of who is crafting your goods and whether it's ethically done. Shit, I'll probably still buy a luxury item once in a while, but my eyes are a lot more open to exactly how much I am paying for the *experience* rather than the goods themselves.	episode_done:True
text:What does business casual mean to you?	labels:It's really dependant upon where you are. In South Florida, business casual is golf slacks and a polo, or a wrap dress with sandals (and this isn't the entirety of business casual in South Florida, I'm just pointing out things that would not generally be seen as such elsewhere.)   The best bet is to go online, find this group's Facebook or Instagram accounts and look at what people are wearing at their events. I doubt very much that anyone is going to bat an eyelash at you wearing a skirt, and I'm sure that your work clothing is absolutely appropriate for whatever events you're attending.

text:Learning about technical side of clothes - fabrics, care, quality etc.	labels:I think a lot of people here that say their clothing falls apart quickly aren't properly caring for their clothes. Growing up I learned to wash everything together on cold. As an adult I had to read articles and watch YouTube videos on how to care for my clothing. I recommend everyone learn how to properly launder their clothing.
text:I agree, I've never understood what people are doing in the laundry to make their clothes literally fall apart after a few washes. Washing on the hottest setting and drying high heat, maybe?  Ive legitimately never had anything fall apart in the wash ever and I dont take particular care other than cold water and low heat in the dryer (plus not chucking things like sweaters, dress shirts and leggings in the dryer at all). And I used the communal machines in my apartment!	labels:I can count on one hand the number of things I have had "fall apart" after a few washes in the last 2 decades (excluding actual laundry errors). Primark tshirt WERE shite quality tissue feeling crap, (worse than the cheapcheapcheap stuff we used to get from the market stalks) in the early 2000s but I've got some now that are 10 years old and still wearable out if the house. The last thing that died in laundry was a fluffy jumper I bought in 3 colours in 2018. One of them unravelled in multiple places first wash. The other 2 still look new tho, after multiple washes.	episode_done:True
text:How do your clothes wear out?	labels:For me, it‚Äôs typically the elasticity of fabrics start to give and the items no longer fit correctly or if it‚Äôs a bottom, they no longer ‚Äústay up‚Äù. This usually happens with leggings or panties after about 5 or more years of regular wear with caring for the items properly.  I also had a faux leather jacket wear out after 6 years of regular wear. The faux leather ended up ‚Äúpeeling off‚Äù or something like that.
text:I just had a jacket peel like that. I'm bummed bc it was one of my favorites. I'd like to try and stop the peeling if I can so I've been hanging on to it and not wearing it!	labels:Agree.me tooüòç	episode_done:True

text:Serious answer...  Geo-politically, in the rundown of the British Empire to the setting up of the modern United Kingdom, British politicians have consciously latched themselves onto the USA due to shared history, languages, similar culture and values.   American culture has had a massive influence on British due to shared language historically. Even in the so-called Golden Age of Cinema most movies shown in Britain were produced in the USA. This carried on by large with new forms of communication and entertainment like TV and social media. Most Western social media is by default American social media even in a globalised world.  Furthermore in the run-up to Brexit and during it currently a lot of political weight has been thrown to a US-UK trade deal. A change in President, or keeping the current, would mean a change in the trade negotiation and political policymaking process. The recent trade deals with Japan and Kenya a tiny in levels of importance. A trade deal with the USA is not.  Finally, we're not due another UK General Election according to the Fixed Term Parliament Act for a while, and I doubt we'd call one during a pandemic with a majority of MPs voting for it. Sometimes the media just want to focus on something else for a time. If you're upset enough you can always complain to the BBC or Ofcom via email.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:How do you feel about vegan/faux leather?	labels:I‚Äôm not a fan tbh. My experience which faux leather is that it does look nice... but not for long because it cracks/peels. Also it‚Äôs not very sustainable because it‚Äôs made of plastics and has a short lifespan (depending on how regularly it is worn). Real leather on the other hand can have a super long lifespan with proper care, and too me it just looks way nicer because real leather items (like boots and bags) are usually made with more care because it‚Äôs a more expensive material. I‚Äôve thrifted all of my leather items too, which is also more sustainable for the environment (and my wallet!)	episode_done:True

text:Does anyone have tips on how to find good stuff from Poshmark and other online thrift shopping platforms?	labels:I shop a lot on Poshmark and I find it helps to think of it as ‚Äúslow‚Äù fashion. I don‚Äôt expect the instant gratification of typical online shopping.   I search for brands that are typically out of my price range, that I love. I save things by liking them and wait to see if the seller will make me a reasonable offer. People sometimes give amazing deals if something has been sitting long enough.   As others have said, use those filters!
text:I've been able to get some great deals by finding a specific item I'm interested in and then doing a new search for just that item. I look through the available listings and if they're all in the same or similar condition I like all of the lower priced ones and wait for the offers to come in.  I do sometimes make offers myself, kinda depends on how much I want the item and how unique it is. Like, I'm much more likely to make an offer on something vintage that I know I won't easily find another of. I have one in my likes right now I'm waffling on but I really do want it. For offers, typically you can expect to make an opening offer around 50-60% of the list price and still be considered reasonable, especially in reseller closets. (Full disclosure I do flip on PM as a small side hustle, I mostly use the funds to buy new things for myself.) There's a 20% commission fee and the shipping discount comes out of the seller's pocket, so they generally list higher to account for these in their profit margins. If I'm lazy and just want the item sometimes I just make an offer that essentially gives myself free shipping lol, better margin for the seller so they're more likely to accept.	labels:	episode_done:True

I‚Äôd love to update my wardrobe, but I don‚Äôt want to buy things just to sit in my closet and possibly not fit or be out of style by the time I can wear them.

text:Have you ever participated in a clothing swap - in person or online?	labels:I used to do clothing swaps in college and in the first years post-college when lots of my friends lived nearby.

It was always exciting when something fit someone else better than the original owner. I still have several pieces from those swaps.   Now that we‚Äôve scattered across the country, I haven‚Äôt done a big swap in a while but when I‚Äôm cleaning out my closet, I do occasionally set aside an item or two that I know a friend would love or look great in. I know a few things have even been handed down to friends of friends - especially a lot of first office job clothes I bought at H&M that have made their way through 3 or 4 people now.	episode_done:True

text:How have you changed your style and/or shopping habits after your body has changed?	labels:I‚Äôm in your boat and have been for several years now.

These days I float between 220-230lbs and most of my weight hangs out in my belly so I look pregnant lol. In my thinner days I liked form-fitting pin-up style clothing. These days I tend to go for loose, flowy blouses,flannels, and sweaters.   For pants I discovered the joy of stretchy paper bag style pants over the summer and in the fall/winter I do anything black and high-waisted. I still refuse to give up skinny jeans though as I detest anything flared. I swapped H&M out for Torrid and I still get most of my clothes at Target as they usually have decent options for work clothes. I‚Äôve recently discovered that Old Navy makes the best fitting, AFFORDABLE jeans for me.	episode_done:True
text:Rick Owens Wearing Rick Owens	labels:I don't own a single piece of his clothing, and I probably never will, but one of the quotes attributed to him that really stuck with me when I first started browsing mfa was "No outfit is going to make you look or feel as good as having a fit body. Buy less clothing and go to the gym instead." He was right.
text:That's probably the single most recognizable quote of his outside diehard avant-garde fashion circles. It needs some contextualizing though. Like everything else, you have to consider where the speaker is coming from. Rick is addicted to working out. He's on steroids. His addiction is understandable because before he got into working out he was doing drugs and was, by his own admission, on a very unhealthy path. His wife got him into working out instead. But he's effectively swapped one addiction for another. Working out is generally one of the best things you can do for your health, but not when you're pushing 60 and regularly taking steroids. When it comes to that Rick quote, it's worth knowing that he's not speaking from a well-balanced position.  All that is to say, the general spirit of the quote is solid advice. But Rick Owens is probably not a good authority on moderation, which as with all activities, should be a part of your workout routine.	labels:Can I get a source on that?

text:yea, Im pretty sad they are so long. I am not into the crop look for winter but when I was looking at details I just saw regular and assumed they would be around 28 inches( didnt see the 30.5 inch measurment online at the time). As someone that's 5'5 I didnt expect a regular length to be to long. Im not sure if I want to pay the 8 dollar return fee again though to go for the crops since I'm having a hard time getting past other fit issues  I might try the rebel pants instead as its stated they are meant for curvier types. I do not like the fitted look though, I prefer the straight leg, I just think they bunch because they are to long	labels:Eh I think that it‚Äôs great piece for fall/winter bc you can wear big sweaters to hide the other fit issues. By the time summer comes, you definitely won‚Äôt be wearing them. But if it‚Äôs only $8 for something you might like better and actually wear, then I would bite the bullet.

Third picture has a Lady Dior that runs about 4000-5000+ new. I'm not familiar with any of the clothing but some brands you could look into as a first step are Undercover and Comme des Gar√ßons (and its various lines).  For the affordability issue, I second going on Yahoo! Japan and other resale sites but you need to know what you're looking for and have some idea of what might be a fake.

Basically they analyze not just the genre of the artists you listen to, but what also what artists you listen to together, and I guess break it down into the smallest bubble of artists that other people also listen to together and ig just give it a random name for categorial purposes...which is not how you fucking define a genre and leads to weird shit like Xiu Xiu, Aphex Twin, and ASAP Ferg being in the same ‚Äú‚Äù‚Äù‚Äùgenre‚Äù‚Äù‚Äù‚Äù, but, whatever, mildly interesting peak under the hood of the machine, and my friend got ‚Äúcity building pop‚Äù so I guess it could be more bs  In other news, anyone else feel like beginning of the year was weighed a lot more heavily than the end? I feel like my own recollection of what I listened to diverged from Spotify‚Äôs account around the start of summer.  ~~and if you didn‚Äôt take The Brave Little Abacus down for 5 months it would have been in my top 5~~	episode_done:True
text:How has your style and shopping habits changed with age and financial standing?	labels:As a recent college grad I had 3 prs of shoes and I thought a polo-style shirt and khakis were all I needed for work. Shopping wasn‚Äôt a big thing.  I was just trying to live independently and pay my bills.  Making outfits was challenging because I didn‚Äôt have the items to make a cohesive wardrobe that could last a work week without re-washing something. I did have a few items for going out that I swapped with friends. Who know where those things ended up.  Mid-career (and middle-aged), I think more about my personal style than trends. I enjoy creating styles that don‚Äôt appear over planned, yet are well put together. I‚Äôve built what I consider a personal fashion archive over the years that I can pull from.  The stores I buy from have changed...or least the % of my wardrobe from certain stores has changed.  I‚Äôm more aware of quality and fabrication, though I sometimes compromise fabric preference for style. Conversely, I will drop some coin on high-quality items made from natural fibers, good shoes, coats,and an occasional luxury handbag (or two).	episode_done:True
text:Favorite brands to thrift?	labels:Honestly I don't have any. What I love about thrifting is seeing pieces removed from the context of their stores, marketing, and other items from the same brand, so I can judge them on their own merits.   I'm not trying to be condescending or corrective at all, though: If you find a brand whose clothes you tend to enjoy at a price point that works for you, more power to you!
text:You didn‚Äôt sound condescending at all! My question was less about brands that you actively seek out and more about brands you kind of just find yourself enjoying over and over. I‚Äôm def in the same school of letting the item speak to me and not searching for brands. When I see that I‚Äôm attracted to certain brands more often, I just think it‚Äôs cool!	labels:	episode_done:True
text:I've taken 566 outfit photos over 4 years (my style from mid-20s to 30)	labels:One thing I've always thought you excelled at was understanding your body and silhouettes. I've always enjoyed your OOTDs (especially your travel posts!) because you knew what worked for your body and repeatedly used that formula. I'm sure taking outfit photos helped, since it's almost like viewing it from someone else's perspective.   I also was wondering where did you get your trench you have in photos from 2020? It's a dream!	episode_done:True
text:Fall/winter shoe trends: what's your dream wishlist?	labels:more over the knee boots. the black ones are good to throw away already. i'd like to get a pair of coloured ones (loved the dark red from last year). perhaps dark green or dark blue.  some chunky heels in colours i don't have. navy blue is the worst offender, but i need a pair of dak green as well.  another season of window shopping flats and not liking anything. i don't know what to say anymore about flats. i should have some yet i don't like anything.	episode_done:True

text:Purses: Real vs. Faux Leather?	labels:Personally I try to avoid faux if possible. Real leather lasts longer, faux leather is just plastic and I find it cracks and/or scuffs usually within a couple years. Granted, I haven't bought any luxury faux leather so maybe that would last longer. Also on the sustainability side I feel like real leather is better (although I'm sure it depends on processing and where it comes from)
text:Leather production is really terrible for the environment too, but since it lasts a looot longer and afaik is waaay more degradable, it's still by far the more environmentally friendly choice unless you purchase a whole lot of it.	labels:Tangentially related, but a lot of leather also comes from cows from the meat industry, so it‚Äôs also good that the entire animal is being used instead of raising a cow just for its hide.
text:how does it make a difference if the entire corpse is used if the process of obtaining it (i.e. torturing and killing an animal) is still cruel and unethical?	labels:It‚Äôs hard to tell if your question is genuine or meant to be inflammatory. I‚Äôll respond as if it‚Äôs genuine.   Most people agree that within morality, there exists degrees of evilness and goodness. In our society we generally find murder to be objectively worse than, say, stealing a phone. Both are bad, one is worse.  In our society, we also find that killing humans is one of the worst things a person can do. However, it is generally accepted that killing animals for meat is okay because we need food to eat. Animal lives are considered less important than humans. Plant lives are considered even less important, but we still kill plants to sustain ourselves. Strict morality would say killing anything is wrong. Practical morality would say killing is wrong but there are types of killing that are less wrong.   It is more cruel to raise cows specifically for their hide. This is akin to trophy hunters that only want the antlers of a deer rather than venison to sustain their family.
text:With very, very few exceptions, humans absolutely do not need to eat meat or any other animal-derived products. We don't kill trillions of animals a year because we need to; we do it because people find pleasure in eating flesh and secretions. Likewise for leather and suede - sure, they're functional and durable for things like boots and purses, but they're also replaceable in most cases by a material that involves far less damage to humans, the environment, and animals.  Do you think I don't know what morality is? Because your  condescending explanation definitely implied that.	labels:I wasn‚Äôt trying to be condescending but instead answer your initial question, which was what the difference was between using an entire corpse of an animal and killing an animal for its hide. As i said initially, i took your question at face value. It seems as though you simply wanted to comment on the ethics of leather as a lifestyle choice rather than a necessity, which, while totally valid, could have been phrased differently to further the discussion in this thread re: faux leather or real leather.	episode_done:True

text:What socks do you guys wear? and some advice on socks please?	labels:Darn Tough
text:would you say they are thick?  also, looking at the site i wanted to confirm. is it $16 per single pair???	labels:Their different thicknesses, from lightest to heaviest, are;  Ultra-light, light, padded light, ultra-light cushion, light cushion, padded cushion, cushion, full cushion, extra cushion.  I use Light for everyday use, Light Cushion for hiking and general outdoorsy stuff, and Ultra-light for the warmest of days.  When I used cotton socks I had lots of pairs and threw them in the laundry basket after each use. With Darn Tough, because they are merino wool blend, i only have a few pairs of each thickness/weight that I cycle through so that they get to air out between uses. They won‚Äôt be needing washing nearly as often as cotton or synthetic socks.	episode_done:True
text:Have you ever gone out on a limb and bought clothing from an unknown brand advertised on Instagram/Facebook/online? How did it work out?	labels:omg! a couple months ago i bought a pair of jeans from revice denim, which is popular i guess w the influencer crowd? anyways, a lot of people had bad reviews about never getting their jeans but some people got theirs quickly so i thought it was worth a gamble.  But its been over 2 months and i still havent gotten anything and i was never able to reach customer service!! when i finally did they said ‚Äúno need for condescending messages we‚Äôre just trying to assist you‚Äù all i did was say ‚Äúthanks again! babe!‚Äù üò©üò©üò©	episode_done:True
text:How do you decide what clothes you ‚Äúneed‚Äù?	labels:This is small but one piece of shopping advice I still use is, ‚Äòwill I wear this tonight?‚Äô Obviously for many items that is not a literal question but I find if I say no that may not be the right item for me.  Helps me pass on things that are nice but not right for my personality or lifestyle. I actually learned a lot from Ines de la Fressange‚Äôs book Parisian Chic. It‚Äôs a very general style book, it‚Äôs less about her taste, which is great, and more about how to have a quality collection that fits you.	episode_done:True
text:Does anyone else not factor in pants when creating outfits? How to move away from this?	labels:I‚Äôve seen a few other comments to this effect... but really a good place to start can just be branching out in denim itself. There are so many different cuts and washes out there now that the particular jeans you‚Äôre wearing can have a big impact on the outfit.  I‚Äôm a big fan of denim, while I have a few pairs of jeans that ‚Äúgo with anything‚Äù I try not to think of them as a default item and pair them with things that make sense for a specific outfit. I have more jeans than most, but that‚Äôs because I‚Äôve decide it‚Äôs what I love and enjoy having a big variety.   Beyond that, I would really think about what other kind of pants fit your style based off of what you lean towards on the top. Something that others see a lot of use out of may have no place in your wardrobe (ex I keep trying to get beige pants, but I can‚Äôt make a single outfit I like with them in my closet - however, I could make several I was happy in with a pair of pink herringbone trousers).	episode_done:True

text:What do you think about having a signature style vs. a variety of looks?	labels:I guess I would say I do, because I don't "use looks/trends" I use shapes and colours that suit me and that fit parts of me i'd like to express.  And that does create a signature "look" without trying too hard because well.. I can't change my shape, and the colours that suit me are very defined within a colour palette.  I'm almost always wearing something stretchy that accommodates my body gently, and I like deep colours, soft colours and neutrals. I can have different elements (such as a romantic element, or a classy element) but the underlying fundamentals of "me" is there.  The problem with having different looks is that less pieces go together and some aesthetics don't really suit people as well as other looks might because the "structure" of the piece clashes with the person. I'm thinking of someone who might like sleek aesthetic inspired by 6 foot tall people, when they are more small and rounded, and it may be better to keep to their lines and add "touches of sleekness". Keep the air of sleekness but twist it in a way that suits them.. in other words, not "copy the aesthetic".	episode_done:True

text:Shitpost Saturday: You Are What You Wear	labels:I was born and raised in California which means I am effectively a lizard person‚Äîfragile and unable to generate my own warmth.

But if you look at the brands of all my cashmere sweaters (Grana, Halogen, C by Bloomingdales) I'm wearing the materials of the wealthy, but from pedestrian brands! I AM A POOR PERSON MASQUERADING AS A RICH PERSON!  And honestly, that's pretty much the most disgusting personality flaw one can have.
text:Fret not, it could be worse. I don't even masquerade properly. I walk around with shirts from Ralph Lauren, St. John's, and a custom tailor....paired with H&M or Express pants, Madewell boots, overpriced socks, and a Mango coat. I'm just a confused person.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Any advice for overcoming self consciousness/self doubt when you're trying to step out of your comfort zone and expand your style?	labels:1. Being ‚Äúoverdressed‚Äù is an absolute myth people have created to hate on other people who are doing what makes them feel great.  2. I‚Äôm currently going through this transition myself. What‚Äôs helped me is really just trying things on that I like but may not necessarily be in my comfort zone and pairing it with someone familiar. So maybe I wear a fancy, feminine top and pair it with some boyfriend jeans (something I wear every day) to help balance it out!	episode_done:True
text:How has lockdown affected new purchases?	labels:I've sold a few clothes I never really wore. Bought one jumper/sweater, a few thermal layers and soft wool casual trousers for working at home. I can wear sweatpants but it doesn't really get me in the working mood, you know?   My best purchase was probably 2 crossbody bags. A cheap one off Uniqlo and a Peak Design bag off eBay for mega cheaps. Easy to throw on, put a mask in, small water bottle, or whatever when I decide to go for a quick walk-break. And the peak design is slightly padded and larger which helps for cameras or small food shops lol.  I *do* have some stuff I want to buy, but honestly it's more lust than utilitarianism. I have enough shoes and jackets as it is. If I bought something new I'd feel obliged to sell something of mine.

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE!- October 25	labels:I got a question about shirt sizing... So I'm a short guy (5ft 6in) and long sleeved shirts are usually a problem for me because I have a large chest/shoulders for my height. I just got a Taylor stitch shirt in XS as that's what they're size guide recommended me. However, as is the case with most shirts I try, it's a bit tight in the back (I have a 38in chest). This only applies if I'm crossing my arms, giving a hug, or tying my shoes or something (basically moving both arms forward). The shirt fits everywhere else and is otherwise fine. I know that it I size up though, the shirt length will be a little too long and the sleeve length will be too long, despite fitting more relaxed in the chest/back area.  Do I size up or retain my current size? Again, the only real problem area is that the shirt hugs my chest a little bit and I feel the fabric strain across my back if I try to cross my arms (not enough so that it feels like it will rip, but it still strains).	episode_done:True

Then I came here and apparently you need to have a name for your ~*aesthetic*~ with at least 4 adjectives "preppy witchy nonsensical space librarian" and I learned that some people seem to buy clothes they don't like because they're "trendy"? And they think that everyone who's "trendy" just buys the latest clothes because they're in fashion and not because they like them?

text:I want to be that bada*** biCTH (Ik it's spelt wrong, it's meme bro lol sry. Plus idk if we can swear, I don't post) tl;dr at the end cuz I tend to rant :)	labels:Now I am by far not a confident person, but somehow I don't care for shit about other people's stares, unless they're catcalling me or something. You being a woc does not make you less badass, I am not a woc but you ladies are literally stunning as hell and your skin tone doesn't prevent you from being the baddest bitch in your block. So what if you're not a skinny white girl, it's not like a certain skin tone or weight determines whether you can be an egirl or not. You are capable to be the baddest egirl being woc and not beansprouty. I'm not sure what to tell you about your family, but I know a girl who would always put on something baggy over something revealing at home and before she left for school, then take it off. That could possibly be an option for when you get to go outside, or just dress like that in your room or something. When I started wearing clothes I thrifted instead of shopping at my small town's h&m or the other 3 fast fashion stores I thought I would get judged, but actually quite the contrary happened and I got compliments on my vintage clothes. I'm not exactly dressing edgy,more very colourful, but at least from people our age, they don't seem to judge edgy clothes. And honestly, when talking about strangers and not family members, I don't think anyone actually judges that hard. Seriously, why care anyway? Other than sorta needing to conform to social norms when looking for a job, like when you need professional pictures for a CV because egirl makeup isn't seen as "professional" or whatever, there's nothing you have to lose. You're not losing friends over glittery makeup and short plaid skirts, if anything, they might rather admire you for your cool new style. And strangers? They're strangers anyway, you won't ever see that mean ass grandma at the grocery store who frowned at your eyeliner ever again, it's not like you dress and do your makeup for her. You'll be a super pretty egirl, you can do that shit
text:Wow thank you for that reply :) that really made me feel better. I guess the stranger thing isn't something to care about honestly, you're right. But it's going to take me a longgg time to reach your level of confidence lol.	labels:I don't really feel very body confident, but honestly what's stopping us other than ourselves from being the baddest bitches, we have all the potential! Honestly I really appreciate other strange people's cool outfits when I see them on the streets. So, wear what you feel comfortable wearing, and if anyone shits on you for your choice of clothing, they don't really deserve your niceness anyway, they're not accepting how you want to express yourself and that is fucking shitty, but if anyone does, then wear whatever you like proudly just to spite their asses, likely they envy your boldness and your style anyway	episode_done:True

text:The joy of cordovan‚Äîand how to wear and maintain it	labels:Cordovan is an Instagram dream - it‚Äôs lustrous and has a ton of color depth. Unfortunately I find  actually wearing it is a different story. It‚Äôs extremely stiff and inflexible, especially during the first 20-30 wears. It‚Äôs the coldest leather I‚Äôve ever worn (like my feet are freezing even with medium wool socks). On the flip side, they are super warm in anything over 75 degrees so I avoid them in summer. Spotting in the rain is incredibly annoying so I‚Äôve just avoided wearing them in high temps, whereas my calf boots are completely fine in summer. Also, they are on dainite soles which are terrible in winter snow or slush.   I‚Äôm glad I own a pair of color 8 Alden 986, and my Viberg bourbon shell service boots. They are great for certain occasions. But in sum, I have a pair of ~$1300 boots that I generally can wear between 40-75 degrees Fahrenheit when there‚Äôs no precipitation or inclement weather. Keep that in mind before you jump into the shell world.
text:My experience has been different with shell, though it varies by manufacturer.  My Alden and Allen Edmonds shoes were all comfortable out of the box, and I wear them in all temps comfortably (always with relatively thin socks).  Ditto my Carmina plain-toe-bluchers, though admittedly these were purchased second-hand.  My Meermin longwings have always been very stiff.  Five years and they haven't loosened a single bit.  However, they are comfortable.  Then my favorites, the Truman captoe boots, have been pretty soft since day one.  They've weathered a lot over time (due to conditions and general lack of care), but still very comfortable.	labels:Love to see some pictures of the Truman.	episode_done:True

I don‚Äôt have a problem with most leggings, but I‚Äôve seen wool leggings by icebreaker and smartwool.

text:Building a sense of style and finding joy in fashion during a pandemic?	labels:I was reading this description the other day, and thinking how much I like it  >We know this woman, she invests in good coats, only wears two pairs of jeans and eight pairs of shoes   When I was in college, my most expensive clothing needs (coats and shoes) were also my most neglected ones.

This kinda off the beaten road Off Saks nearish me was also next to the Nordstrom rack that I wanted to go to looking for a gift. So eh, I just walked over to see what they have in Off Saks. Immediately when I walked in they had portioned off tons of racks for their off the runway selection or something. Well. I tried on everything I wanted. True runway brands. Dresses skirts, shirts, sweaters everything... And I almost cried. They were all so beautiful and colorful. Everything fucking fit. I was just blown away. The construction was perfect, the silk was the softest ever... And I nicely put it all back on the hangers and hung everything back up where I found it... It was like my own personal runway in the dressing room. When I left however.. I was definitely upset. Going back to some clothes I own that I know I wear but are just.. awful quality or really don't fit correctly.. took me a minute to get over it honestly.	episode_done:True

I've accepted the shit, and now it's time to...not move on because social distancing and wearing masks are still important, but I guess to just make do how best we can.   i've been feeling a lot more comfortable wearing weird clothes and experimenting with new things lately. i feel anonymous behind my mask, like i can get away with something i might not have been able to otherwise. and that is such a great feeling. not only is it liberating but i feel so confident and happy. i went grocery shopping last weekend in punk boots with high-waisted sparkly camo leggings and a cropped hoodie. i'd never have worn that out before! (at least maybe not during the day, and definitely not grocery shopping!!)  and it feels sort of great to feel that way now. yeah things suck but i'm wearing sparkly camo leggings right now and i feel great!  i'm hoping that when this is all over and things settle into a new normal maybe that experience will help others like it's been helping me. maybe people will be more comfortable being themselves, and feel less pressure to dress a certain way, and just do what makes them happy!	episode_done:True

text:Article: Why Is Fashion So Beige This Season?	labels:The last time I remember noticing beige getting popular was around 2009 (the great recession). I was going to fashion school at the time and one of my profs noted that neutrals tend to come in style when the economy tanks because the pieces are more versatile. Like, there's only so many ways you can wear a bright pink top, but you can generally wear neutrals with everything.  Anyhow, I've noticed color palettes are trending more neutral again and I took it as a sign that fashion folks are taking into account that during the pandemic customers are trying to stretch their buys as far as possible.  Tbh, I don't feel strongly about it except that what I think it signifies makes me sad. I think it's triggering some minor trauma from my early adulthood and the recession ü§£
text:Boring neutrals have been "in" for like 10 years though. Recession or not, this isn't a new development.	labels:Heck, after years of black, black & more black, the boring neutrals are comparatively colorful.   Personally, I'm thinking about wearing boring neutrals with a strong color. Like greys & beiges with a red coat/shoes/purse (or all 3). Or olives and sages with a purple.

Soak them in the sink with Eucalan for a half hour, wring out, roll in a towel to take downstairs to the drying rack, dry flat. It takes the same amount of time as finding the mesh delicates bags, washing on delicate, being nervous that I‚Äôve ruined them, and drying flat.	episode_done:True

text:Negative Self-Talk re: Fashion Choices	labels:Oof, I definitely know those thoughts. I'm sorry your brain is being a jerk right now. <3  Something I've had some success with (and YMMV) is to constantly remind myself that "Clothes are supposed to fit ME, I'm under no obligation to fit THEM." If a pair of pants doesn't fit me comfortably, then the problem is with the pants, not my body. Items of clothing are inanimate objects and I owe them nothing. It's far from a perfect system and I don't always succeed, but it does help sometimes.  On a more practical front, have you considered using a tailor? From the problems you describe it sounds like you've got more of a waist-to-hip/leg difference than most brands allow for, and if that's the case, it's actually something that a tailor can fix pretty easily (and often relatively cheaply.) You would just buy pants that fit your legs comfortably and get the waist taken in. Fair warning, though: once you've worn clothes that actually fit you the way they're supposed to you'll never be satisfied with ill-fitting pieces again.	episode_done:True

text:Who else has sensory issues that has figured out ways to not dress boring?	labels:I find skirts work well for me in that there is no tightness around my legs. If it is really cold I will wear tights too, but they have to fit well and not constrict anywhere. No pressure on my knees, no seams or fabric bunches pressing into my nethers like I might have with trousers or jeans.  I like to feel the swish of a skirt, but from the sounds of it, your trousers wrapping around your legs don't make you feel happy so that may not be something that works for you.  I just find I feel less constricted in a skirt.  I tend to go for circle skirts of knee length or longer.  I'm fussy about fabric too, I don't have any patience for polyester or acrylic or anything that might make me feel sweaty or overheated.   With a skirt I just have the one measurement to be worried about, the waist measurement. As long as that fits well and is natural fibre, I'm golden.	episode_done:True
text:Advice needed: How to keep up with trends without social media?	labels:Your best bet is going old school and following blogs. Set up an RSS feed, find people you like, and follow fashion that way.   But this is also a good time for you to explore YOUR personal style, without the influence of... uh... influencers. Obviously some of the fun of fashion is finding out what the trends are as dictated by other people, but with a little freedom from those, you might create silhouettes and combinations that are far more interesting to you personally than whatever's popping off on IG this week.  You can also do what I do and set up an IG that's just for this kind of thing. I don't follow anyone I know, I don't post anything on there. It's just for me to keep up with fashion, some bands I like, and a few owls managed to sneak their way in there. If you set up something like that, you can set aside an hour on the weekend and get caught up on fashion stuff without even installing the app on your phone. A lot of influencers are on YouTube too, so if you'd prefer to stay away from IG altogether, you can just look for their YouTube pages and watch their content on the weekend.

text:How do you think access and privilege affect your taste and sense of style?	labels:It's interesting for me to read other people's dislike of thrift clothes, and based on their stories I can see why. For me, thrift has been a different experience. When I was in middle school I hated it and unless it was Gap or something like that and you could not tell it was thrift AT ALL I'd refuse to wear what my mom got from a thrift store. I didn't really fit in with most of my peers. Not necessarily because of money, but mostly because I grew up kind of sheltered and then we moved to the DC area. I was suddenly teased because I liked to read and didn't wear Adidas or whatever. So for a long time I tried to fit in through clothes but it still never worked. I still didn't fit in. And I could never quite get the clothes right.  But as I got older I started wanting to differentiate myself from the other upper middle class kids I lived with (we weren't rich by any means but the DC area is an expensive place to live so I was privileged, even if it didn't feel like we had a lot). Thrift clothes were a way to do that that I could afford. Instead of wearing Abercrombie like all the other kids, which we couldn't really afford anyway, I chose to wear old men trousers and sweaters and weird T shirts from thrift shops. So thrift shopping became part of the control I had over my clothes in ways I didn't otherwise have. My "weird" choices were now *my* choice, rather than something I did because I couldn't afford anything else. And even if people thought it was weird that I wore ballet slippers and long wool skirts, it was a style I chose and honestly, I still am impressed by my teen style... sometimes. I like that I went for it and didn't care about how others perceived it.  I still think of thrift that way. And I've found stuff there that is unique and higher quality than I'd feel comfortable spending otherwise. I can experiment without feeling anxiety about how much I spend. And I really can't stand fast fashion, so there's that too.	episode_done:True

Why do so many men hold the sentiment that ‚Äúdressing up‚Äù equates to being uncomfortable? I just went to a Christmas service at an employee‚Äôs rural church where everyone wears jeans or other 5 pocket pants and oxfords. No problem with that at all, but 4 or 5 people made comments about my slacks/shirt/tie/bomber jacket/boots(he said be casual...I still over dressed with the tie) with things like ‚Äúman I‚Äôm glad someone can wear those‚Äù.   Who hurt these people? Are teenage men being put in some awful $99 suits and being traumatized? I have never worn less than a decent department store suit so maybe I am blind to struggles of others, but even a $300 department store suit is quite comfortable. Nothing compared to 100% wool tailored pants that feel like amazing pajamas, but still comfortable compared to jeans.
text:Because 90% of people only wear slacks to work, a place they probably don‚Äôt really want to be, and conflate being uncomfortable at work with the clothes themselves being uncomfortable.

Winter dresses are either long (past the knee) or if it is short, is worn with dark colored stockings/nylons/leggings. Winter dresses are typically darker colors- blacks, browns, dark green, navy, burgundy, etc.  A summer dress is usually lighter in fabric and lighter in color- whites, yellows, periwinkle, taupe, etc. A summer dress can be long- but if it‚Äôs long than the top should be short sleeved or tank top/halter etc so you don‚Äôt overheat.	episode_done:True

I save things I like within my price range (including things that are currently too expensive, as they could go on sale). I save things I come across elsewhere that I like to Pinterest.   When I have something in the 'asap' category, I check my saves in the most applicable app/store, and choose from there.	episode_done:True

text:Knee-high boots, classy heels, or trendy sneakers?	labels:Well I have been wearing sneakers with dresses/skirts on a regular basis since I was around 13 or so. Typically minimal types or when I was way younger even Keds. I am 42 now so that is like 30 years.   I also like pointy flats and those are a more walkable and polished option - and have been doing so since my early 20s. I also like ankle boots and have also been wearing those since my 20s.    These 3 are the shoes I wear the most - pointy flats, ankle boots, and sleek sneakers. I wear a lot of flats - those get the most use. The other two are regulars that can be a bit more seasonal.  In the before times it would be something like 4-5 days a week with flats and 2-3 days of sneakers. And in the winter or rainy season the boots replace the flats for many days.   I do not do heels very often and have been swapping out the ones I have for block heels since they do not get messed up on sidewalk grates. I love a slingback or mule so those are the styles I get the most.   I do not do knee high boots for a myriad of reasons.

If I had the money, I'd greatly prefer to just go to someone else to produce it, but if you don't know design and pattern-making, then you're going to also have to pay someone to do that. You won't be able to go to a manufacturer and be like "here's my idea", they want very detailed and precise patterns to work from. It's an entire job in and of itself.    There's just so much missing here it's hard to even give advice, I have no idea what you do/don't know - about clothing, about business, and about marketing.	episode_done:True

I bought some really fun colours, mustard yellow, light pink, floral patterns, pastel blue, etc.   I used to style them primarily with black, dark, grey, white, chambray tops/blouses.

text:What are some differences between stereotypical Millennial and Gen Z fashion/aesthetics?	labels:I associate Gen Z fashion with crop tops and sweatpants, so yeah it makes sense that people in their 30's buying expensive ethical clothes aren't going for the sporty spice look.
text:Totally.  To me, Gen Z is a lot of clothing that isn‚Äôt work appropriate but super fun. A lot of crop tops, bra tops, spaghetti straps, usually some tummy showing, and then some baggy pants. Lots of thrifting and also cheap fast fashion. Doc Martens and other platform shoes. Very 90s/early 2000s. Long acrylic nails, false lashes. Really fun and can be a really ‚Äúhot but trashy‚Äù style   Millennial fashion is more professional/better quality/structured. Linens, trousers, heels, sandals, etc. Frankly I think it has to do with millennials having more money. Low key hair, nails and makeup. Neutral colours and patterns.

I'm kinda anxious that they look like clown shoes on me lol. What anxiety I've had from wearing normal chucks have doubled with this pair.   Here's some pictures and videos of me wearing said pair. Is there such a difference between this pair and my other shoes? And yeah, I'll probably exclusively wear this with wide pants. I'm aware slimmer pants just fuck up the silhouette way too much.  Height is 173 cm. Average build, around 155lbs or so.
text:They're cool don't sweat it, just wear and enjoy them. They're a bit chunkier than regular chucks for sure but with the wider pants they work well.

text:How to build an age-suitable varied chic wardrobe?	labels:I dressed ‚Äúolder‚Äù when I was your age, but no one thought I was older because I still looked and seemed like a kid! Your face gives it away. :)  Now is a good time to experiment with fashion and figure out what you want. It is ok to make mistakes, and change your mind. Your style and body could change as you get older so no need to focus on ‚Äútimeless classics.‚Äù You have plenty of time for that.   The current trends for people your age feel so much like what it was when I was your age. There are always people who skip the street wear part! You don‚Äôt have to do if you don‚Äôt like it. Keep playing with the things you are drawn to.	episode_done:True
text:How do you handle budget increases when it comes to clothes? (ex. going from student to working professional)	labels:I don't have a prescribed budget that I stick to, but I try my best to ensure I max out my generous 401k match and other accounts provided from my employer. I have a certain amount I keep stashed away as an emergency fund if I can't work for several months, some for paranoia from being raised lower-income and some for the fact that I live in a HCOL area. Other than that, I am super flexible with how I spend my money, which is ~dangerous~. Luckily, fashion and food are my only pricey hobbies. I'm really privileged to be in this position with a rewarding job and understand that this is not the norm for many.  I got a substantial promotion and raise this last summer, so I definitely have been overspending this year as I try to ramp my wardrobe back to my ideal self, rather than my more practical self; I was also purchasing a limited number of pieces since I was in a client-facing role making half as much. I moved from buying clothes on the more affordable spectrum (mainly pre-scandal Everlane, and KOTN) to buying pricier pieces, usually in the pre-owned designer spectrum (mainly bags, shoes, and outerwear ranging from $200-$3000). I'm finally scaling back by having a curated wishlist and aiming to resell any unused pieces (easier said than done).	episode_done:True

text:Whats with all the "stretchy mens pants" startups I am seeing all of a sudden?	labels:This is only me personally, and disagrees with the current vibe on this sub, but here goes.  I think people want the look of well-fitted, tailored, bordering on skinny pants.  I think the majority of the (western) world sees these tighter fitting clothes as more attractive.  However, they're not the most comfortable in many cases.  They restrict movement.  Reddit's answer and even to a degree forward-ish fashion has been to get loose fitting things and create a vibe around that look.  Big silhouettes and wide lines.  It's super comfortable.  The middle ground is to get tighter fitting clothes that still move with you - you have the look of the skinny clothes with the freedom of the loose clothes.	episode_done:True

text:How do you style your existing wardrobe in a way that doesn‚Äôt get boring?	labels:I am a very ordinary person so take this with a grain of salt. What I would do is a commitment to wear sth "new" every day. It's just not how you put it on and look at the mirror, but it also has to do with how you feel in it all day long.   Sometimes it's gonna work, sometimes it won't but you can have fun with your wardrobe everyday and hopefully you will find what goes well with what you have inside that huge wardrobe.   You are young so you can be daring.  You will be surprised.  Good luck and happy trying :)	episode_done:True
text:What to do when nothing fits you properly?	labels:Clothing doesn‚Äôt fit most people off the rack.  Each brand has a fit model and proportions in mind that likely do not match you.  Clothes should fit you. You shouldn‚Äôt need to mold yourself to fit them. So with that in mind - find ways and places to get the fit adjusted to suit you.   1. The way if fits off the rack isn‚Äôt the end all of the fit journey - tailoring is your friend. Many things can be adjusted to fit you and your proportions  2. Figure out what you want to accentuate and deaccentuate.  This will guide you on to shapes to start with as a base.  3. Some brands will be a lot closer to fitting you than others.  And one brand that works for pants might be terrible for shirts and vice versa. Trial and error is important.  4. Find a body twin to get inspiration from.	episode_done:True
text:Are LBD‚Äôs really a MUST?	labels:Nope.  If there‚Äôs a funeral or school- or work-related event I MUST go to, I already have a plain black suit I wear to interviews, and I can just use that.

text:Lol yup. Even outside of that association, I‚Äôve never seen a polo shirt, no matter how well fitting, that I thought looked better than any t shirt or button up would have looked. Different strokes though.	labels:I reckon polo shirts only ever really look good on men who work out and have well-developed biceps.  On most other people, a different shirt would look better.

text:What are you planning on getting rid of this year?	labels:In the last few weeks, I have either sold or donated all of my denim save for one pair (for working outside, on the car, etc.).  I'd consider picking up a pair of high rise denim in the future, but for now my wardrobe works better with wool and linen bottoms.	episode_done:True
text:what are your fashion flaws?	labels:I simultaneously buy things I like regardless of having the occasion to wear them and also have a tendency to "save the good stuff" for these nonexistent occasions, which has resulted in a practical overabundance of clothes that are just a little too dressy for my lifestyle, and that this year I have literally had no reason whatsoever to touch...  I also don't know if it's just me but I'm constantly hooking parts of my clothing (belt loops esp) on cabinet handles?
text:Yes!    Pre COVID, I modified my shopping to focus on stuff that I can wear to my casual office (even if it‚Äôs on the dressy side), and I wore that shit all the time.   Now I wear a bunch of super casual/slob clothes bc I‚Äôm trying to keep cool/warm while minimally running the A/C or heater.  My graphic tee collection hasn‚Äôt seen so much action in years, hah.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Thank all of you	labels:Love the story, but the last paragraph worries me. You‚Äôre just getting into good shoes! Don‚Äôt spend the thousands on Allen Edmonds, because soon you‚Äôll be learning more and more about great shoes and will start looking for better. AE is a great place to start, but leave yourself some room- there are dozens of great brands for you to discover! Up to ‚Äúa few thousand‚Äù you can look at TLB Mallorca, Carmina, Enzo Bonaf√©, John Lobb RTW, Edward Green- there are a lot of better places to spend that kind of money on shoes, and if I could‚Äôve gone back I would‚Äôve skipped spending on the low end with AE and Meermin until I learned about the higher end shoes I have today. It‚Äôs a deep field and an addicting one, so good luck!
text:I appreciate the thought. I have 6-8 pairs of shoes I wear regularly that are now the wrong size and I resent putting on. I am sure you are right that there are better shoes out there but to start I need a whole new stable of shoes that don‚Äôt hurt.	labels:As someone who has a few hundred pairs of shoes just remember that different brands have different sizing. There's really no right or wrong size. It really depends on the last used to make the shoe.	episode_done:True
text:Changing your mindset from fast fashion to one of investment pieces. What did you learn?	labels:You can find quality items + tailoring for less than $200. Make sure to read what expensive clothes are made out of - just because a shirt costs $200 doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs good quality. You can also thrift good quality vintage clothing for less than $20.   I bought a blazer almost 5 years ago for around $150, tailored it, and it fits perfectly to this day. Pair that with a white 100% cotton t-shirt from The Gap ($15 max) and a real gold necklace ($$$$$) and you have yourself a business casual outfit for work. My dress pants and jeans are also all tailored.   I would say statement pieces - jewelry, shoes, bags - look cheap if they actually are cheap. Invest in quality leather shoes, an expensive watch, and gold/silver jewelry. I find that some tops and jeans from Forever 21 and Zara don‚Äôt look cheap if you tailor them and know how to style them. However if you buy cheap $20 shoes and a $5 fake gold necklace, an expert eye can tell and you‚Äôll look quite tacky.   Just my 5 cents!  ETA: you don‚Äôt need to buy $200 items of clothing, but you also can‚Äôt buy $10 clothing. You need to find something in the middle. Don‚Äôt shop at stores like  Primark, but you can still find a decent blazer or pair of dress pants at Zara or H&M. My personal favourite for work clothes is Banana Republic. Their dress pants are less than $80 and they frequently go on sale. However, do NOT buy statement pieces at these stores as I mentioned before.	episode_done:True

text:‚ÄúI'm all locked down with nowhere to go ‚Äì but that hasn't killed my lust for fashion‚Äù	labels:I have one suggestion, get dressed and take pictures. It doesn't have to be for Instagram/facebook. It can be for just yourself. If you really like an outfit, remember it with a picture. You can take it in a park, or at a location that is memorable for you, with your SO, or with your cat. You should at least get a few good pictures with you pet in the 10+ years they reside with you.  It's actually a fun learning experience, on how to use the cameras. I am interested in photography and usually use a dslr, but for selfies, dslrs are not as good. With an iphone, I think it's an entirely different genre of photography. You have to use completely different lighting system, etc., to use it to its full potential.

Wearing doc martens with shorter cropped, loose fitting jeans and showing your socks would have been social suicide a decade ago when I came of age (skinny everything, trainers with everything). I like the look but I feel uncomfortable when I wear it - any advice on getting past this? My head knows it looks better than wearing them with my skinny jeans but my heart says ‚Äúyou will get bullied at school (work)‚Äù  TL;DR bought some docs, like them, but how do I stop feeling like a dork?

I guarantee you'll at least find a nice navy blazer that fits, if not entire suits, etc. It is insanely easy to go full prep just by buying thrift store kids section Polo and Brooks Brothers, trust me.

text:How do you style your existing wardrobe in a way that doesn‚Äôt get boring?	labels:Echoing a few suggestions here re: accessories and shoes with some examples I‚Äôve done this fall/winter.  My standard fall/winter wardrobe is also a sweater, jeans and ankle boots. Some variations I‚Äôve tried:  I saw Pinterest inspo of statement red socks with Oxfords and I usually only wear oxfords in spring/summer because it feels too cold in fall winter. I bought a pair of red/burgundy cashmere socks from j crew and wore those today with my black oxfords, black jeans and white sweater with black stripes.  Wearing ‚Äúdressy‚Äù sneakers. I bought some MOMA vans, I have a out of burgundy suede and tweed new balance sneakers I wear to work and I want to get a basic black pair of adidas shoes. Similar goes for slip on sneakers, I have a pair of Kate spade leopard print Keds and a red leather pair of Olukais with a pretty floral design.  I have an amazing blanket scarf and even wearing a very thin black sweater or long sleeve t shirt with the blanket scarf I always get compliments even though that‚Äôs my comfy outfit. It‚Äôs not a chunky sweater but it‚Äôs still warm.  When I want to look a bit dressier I really do love wearing sweater dresses or just thicker regular dresses and tights/leggings with ankle boots as well. For slightly thinner dresses throwing a long cardigan over top.	episode_done:True

text:Naked and Famous Raw Denim Review/Fit/Experience	labels:I‚Äôm a personal stylist who focuses JUST on women‚Äôs jeans and in all my years of experience I‚Äôve only put raw denim on 2 of my clients for this exact reason. It‚Äôs too difficult to really nail the fit.... and if you do, there‚Äôs a good chance it‚Äôll change as the jeans settle out or if your body changes. Plus, cutting around curves is super tough.   Raw denim is awesome in theory. It ages with you and confirms to your body. And the look of it over time is so cool. But I‚Äôve almost never seen it work with women, especially in skinnier cuts. There‚Äôs just no give.   I would otherwise recommend vintage Levi‚Äôs or 100% cotton premium denim in a heartier weight for a more structured jean. The difference it that it‚Äôs been rinsed/washed so the fit is more predictable and longer lasting than raw denim.

text:How do you style your existing wardrobe in a way that doesn‚Äôt get boring?	labels:I've found that actually cutting down on the number of clothes that I have (selling what I can, donating the rest), has actually helped me be more thoughtful and creative about what I do have, rather than being overwhelmed by the sheer number and defaulting to basics.  Stylebook is great at well - building looks, having the app randomly create outfits for you, but also saving inspiration photos. Sometimes I see people on IG and think "wow that outfit is so great!" and when I really look at it closer, I realize that I'll have similar items in my closet already, but I didn't think to combine them in that way. So I save those photos in the Stylebook app as a reminder of how I can shake up my basics. If you do choose to use the app, you'll see what you actually wear and may feel a bit more justified in letting go of pieces you don't reach for that are sunk costs & taking up space.	episode_done:True
text:Handbag conundrum: lesser know (and lesser seen all over the place) or standard luxury designer bags (think the usual Gucci, YSL, LV, etc.)	labels:Definitely buy what makes you happy. The fact that you have looked at the high end, well known brands and came away disappointed indicates that (this season at least), they aren't for you.   To answer your question directly: for me, personally, showing my own style is 1000% more important than showing the status of a luxury brand. Do the two sometimes overlap? Yes, and that's fine. But I don't personally get buying something *just* because it is a certain brand. Who are you trying to impress? What are you conveying with that logo (wow, you're well off? What kind of message is that, on its own?) I just feel like people who are super into labels, not the design or the style or anything else, just come across as kind of immature? The truth is, anyone worth spending much time with isn't overly concerned with what logo your bag has. (Now! I will concede there is a difference between showing off luxury brands and having higher end items, in some circles. Like, there could be some tension if you're hanging out with super millionaire socialites and everything you wear is from TJ Maxx...but in that case, I'd still say its important to focus on personal style first. And knowing about smaller higher end designers, rather than designers you can buy at a mall, is a whole different thing too...)
text:I feel like showing off the logo is more of a poor person trying to look rich thing. Truly wealthy people don't try to show off like that. Also, a lot of the purses with very prominent logos are fugly.	labels:Truly wealthy people wear whatever they want because they don't have anything to prove or disprove. The Kardashians are very rich yet they have no problem wearing leggings and a t-shirt or being all decked out in Balmain, Gucci, LV.
text:100% this. This whole "truly wealthy people are classy" narrative that's so popular here is so incorrect.	labels:It might be tied in with old money/new money. New money might (like the kardashians) dress more loud, old money might dress more subtle. But even then, it's still a matter of personal taste. The Kardashians and other non rich people enjoy the loud look, that's fine, other rich and regular people don't, that's also fine.
text:Exactly, a matter of personal taste. I grew up with two billionaire's daughters (both going back at least three generations of extreme wealth), one would never wear (and still doesn't) any obvious logos or luxury designer items, the other would wear head-to-toe Chanel on the regular- she was gifted her first Chanel bag at age ten. She didn't care that "classy" people aren't supposed to wear one designer head-to-toe. When your inheritance is in hundreds of millions, you don't give a fuck what "classy" is supposed to be. That's for upper-middle class trying to be upwardly mobile.	labels:>When your inheritance is in hundreds of millions, you don't give a fuck what "classy" is supposed to be.  Yes! 100% this. And honestly, I think everybody should not care and just wear whatever they want (as long as it's appropriate lol).	episode_done:True

text:Does anyone else not factor in pants when creating outfits? How to move away from this?	labels:I was like this too and just had skinny jeans in different washes for a long time. In the past year or so I‚Äôve collected some more interesting jeans that I love to wear even more and change up every outfit but are still jeans. For example, I have looser fit jeans that have a paper bag waist, looser jeans that have a pinstripe wash pattern, jeans with a plaid wash pattern, wide leg jeans with buttons instead of a fly. I think this, along with the different colored jeans others have mentioned, is a good way to change up your look while still keeping the comfort of jeans.  I‚Äôve found these jeans from Hollister, Levi‚Äôs, Gap.  I myself have been looking to upgrade my wardrobe a little bit by looking for some dress pants that I could use to dress up otherwise casual outfits. For inspiration I would look to pinterest or stylist tiktoks. @morgankvogel is a toktoker I just came across that had some aesthetic inspiration tiktoks I liked and she included some stores to get started.	episode_done:True
text:Learning about technical side of clothes - fabrics, care, quality etc.	labels:I think a lot of people here that say their clothing falls apart quickly aren't properly caring for their clothes. Growing up I learned to wash everything together on cold. As an adult I had to read articles and watch YouTube videos on how to care for my clothing. I recommend everyone learn how to properly launder their clothing.
text:I may be totally wrong, but I bet at least some of those "my clothes fall apart after first wash" may just be people laundering their own clothes for the first time and not really knowing that figuring out your washing machine and its settings is quite significant to how your clothes will come out.  My clothes looked rough when I used to just dump them all in a big ball into a laundrette washing machine and tumble dry them. Now that I have my own washing machine, use custom settings and and air dry the clothes (or hand wash in the sink if needed), they stay looking new way longer.	labels:I also think it has to do with the quality of the clothes and isn't always the washers fault. When a shirt is super cheap and mostly polyester or theres issues in the sewing it will fall apart pretty quickly	episode_done:True
text:Style rut: Pinterest vs reality	labels:Well you can get ideas from it, like what silhouettes or color schemes you like. Are there loose dresses or tight pants? Are they in pastel colors or in neons? You can then look for items that fit into that sort of style.  You can also see if any items frequently show up in your board. If, for example, you‚Äôre constantly seeing neutral colored cardigans or black boots, those are items you can actually go and buy.	episode_done:True

Even worse, what if I babied them and stressed about keeping them pristine and STILL couldn‚Äôt sell them later on?  In the past when I‚Äôve gotten lucky with recouping costs on items sold, it‚Äôs always been an unexpected surprise and on random contemporary brands like Aritzia and LL Bean (??). Meanwhile my HE stuff seems to park forever.
text:Yeah, the extra stress of maintaining the purchase would get old. That's one of the reason I avoid clothing rentals. Interesting about the contemporary brands though, that makes me think (unsurprisingly) resale demand is driven largely by what is popular among the majority (which would be tricky to predict).	labels:Aritzia resale is very popular in canada	episode_done:True

It‚Äôs really a cesspool.   Ivy is a breakdown of ‚ÄòTrad‚Äô style, whichever way you cut it leaves room for interpretation and that‚Äôs the beauty of it. The whole point of Ivy style was rebellion.

They‚Äôre super flattering, they hold in my belly, and they don‚Äôt get baggy in the waist even after multiple wears. To extend the life of your jeans, try to wash them as little as possible and keep them out of the dryer!

I did way too much "fill the hole in your soul with stuff" this year, for obvious reasons, but I feel overburdened with the amount of clothing in my life now and I need to make a conscious effort to pare things down. If I run into a genuine need, I'll continue checking secondhand options first before buying new. I'll also continue logging outfits daily with Stylebook, because it helps me be honest with myself about what is and isn't getting worn in my closet (both for getting-rid-of purposes AND for informing-future-purchases purposes), *and* it'll help me focus in on what I gravitate toward in my day-to-day life rather than continually shopping for some nebulously just-out-of-reach fantasy self.   Summed up:  * Buy less, buy secondhand, buy practical, buy for TODAY (not a dream and a half from now), and buy only what is genuinely needed (very likely *nothing* for quite a while).  * Continue evaluating what I really need in my life, and how much, and adjust accordingly as time goes on with the goal of seriously paring down my closet to a manageable size.
text:Also, be conscious about the "need" aspect. People tend to say that they need a new sweater, when they really mean they want a new sweater in a different color to match better with some stuff in their wardrobe.  I stopped years ago with those kinds of purchases, because I realized the "shop sustainable" is just talk from people that want to keep buying while not feeling as wasteful.  I haven't bought any clothes for years. No shoes. I have huge style holes in my "fashion matching wardrobe", but I solve that by just not wearing certain items together.  The truth is, it's a bit boring, from a fashion standpoint. I sit there show creaming my old boots and fixing a hole in my bag. But then again, if you already have a sweater, you don't need another one. If you already have a pair of summer shoes, you don't need another pair, no matter how bad they match with some things in your wardrobe.  If one always keeps this in mind, it will feel stupid to replace a super basic pair of pants that are beyond repair with a pair of pants that don't fill the most functions possible. Aka, no sequin pants that can only be worn with heels and a tube top.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Does AGE really effect your choice of Fashion - Clothing Trends (Discussion)	labels:I‚Äôm 40, so here is an old‚Äôs perspective on this. I do think that certain super-trendy looks which work on a 25-year-old can look silly on an older guy, particularly if he seems uncomfortable. But at least he‚Äôs trying! What‚Äôs far more common is older guys whose shopping habits don‚Äôt change at all between age 25 and 45, and they‚Äôre still wearing band t-shirts to most social functions and showing up to weddings in a suit they bought in 2005 when they were 30 pounds lighter. Here, age is negatively impacting their look, not because they‚Äôre trying to look too young, but because they‚Äôre stuck in the past.  From a younger guy‚Äôs perspective, when I was 25 I remember feeling frustrated that my social circle wore nothing but hoodies everywhere, and my lifestyle didn‚Äôt really afford me many opportunities to dress up. While I totally agree that dressing well doesn‚Äôt mean dressing up, I‚Äôve always liked to dress up. And I was a little annoyed that I couldn‚Äôt wear a blazer out to a dive bar without someone making a joke about my yacht club membership. This is an area where as I got older, my lifestyle changed so that I had a lot more opportunities to wear tailoring and other more ‚Äúadult‚Äù clothes, both at work and in my social life. At least until COVID. My 25-year-old self would have enjoyed wearing a lot of the stuff in my 2021 closet (maybe with some tweaks to the fit!), but he would have had nowhere to actually wear it.	episode_done:True
text:How do you decide what clothes you ‚Äúneed‚Äù?	labels:In general, nobody needs clothes, but want clothes instead.  You wish you could get a subscription for your clothes and identify gaps etc etc. You can, just get a personaly stylist, they'll do that job for you.
text:I second this: I‚Äôve bought too many clothes too many times to fit into a trend that doesn‚Äôt fit my style or body type.

text:How does a warm weather wardrobe differ from a cold weather wardrobe?	labels:New Orleans is super humid all summer. Dresses, shorts, and athletic/moisture wicking fabrics will be your best friend.   You‚Äôll be able to get by with one coat that you may never wear. I have pictures of me at Mardi Gras (in February) in short sleeves and jeans, perfectly comfortable.   Light cardigans for going inside are a great idea for southern summers. They have to blast the AC just to control the humidity.   It‚Äôs also important to consider what that humidity will do for your hair!

text:Pros and cons of an a capsule wardrobe?	labels:Disclaimer-- I know myself well enough to know that a capsule wardrobe is not for me.  When I get back from traveling, I cannot wait to wear different clothes.  Consider your laundry situation.  Having a smaller wardrobe means that you will be doing laundry more often.  If you're one in a family of 6, it may not be a big deal.  But for a single apartment dweller (pay per load), the additional costs can add up quickly.   Because I pay per load, I make sure that I maximize the capacity and only wash full loads (I'm paying the same no matter the capacity).  I am not one to hand-wash clothes in a bathroom sink.  Not now, not ever!   I do laundry roughly every other week alternating lights and darks.  (Sheets and towels are their own ballgame, and I will sometimes throw things in with them.)
text:Just curious but why didn't you get a washing machine for the apartment?	labels:Some condos either don't have space or they don't have the right connections. I do wonder if some rental apartments mandate coin laundry.

text:I actually hate my Ruggable. I love the design, but it is horrible for a house with dogs that shed a lot. The only way I‚Äôve found to get hair out of the rug is to get down and scrape it with my hands.

text:Women that work labor jobs, what parts of your wardrobe are most important to you?	labels:If you don't have any requirements about synthetic fabrics, you have a lot more options. Are you in a climate controlled warehouse? I basically dress for outside weather every day just in case I get stuck out there all day.  Golf polos and dark jeans. T-shirts and tops with fancy/formal detailing (like a half zip and a little pocket, or a fabric with a neat pattern or modest see-through or lacey details on the shoulders). If they have giveaway or purchasable polos with the company logo those are a good option. I used to only wear unisex cotton blend tshirts to work on the days when I would be sweating a lot, but I invested in some nicer athletic fabric v neck tees from Under Armour and now even drenched in sweat I at least look better than I did in high school marching band camp. Also on the topic of sweating, if you know you'll get gross, bring a change of clothes so you can look and feel fresh for your afternoon meetings!  I've seen some womens' only safety toe brands, but never tried them. I use the free boot truck at work. But they have some that we call the "el jefe" boots, that look more like boating shoes or desert boots or are a nicer looking leather. Those might be a good option to make you feel confident and put together.  I think fit goes a long way to make you look professional (and like a boss).

text:Synthetics in Our Wardrobe	labels:This subreddit has a serious hate boner for synthetics and I will never understand why. It seriously depends on the fabric and the purpose of the garment. Not all rayon or viscose or polyester or nylon is the same. It's like you said, the Uniqlo heattech or their amazing wrinkle-free perfectly drapey rayon blouses are so good. Is all rayon wrinkle free or behave like that? lol no... Which is why you need to look at reviews or touch the material yourself. When you touch it, you can just tell it's good...  Not all "natural" materials are elegant or good either. Sometimes stuff like linen is so trash-bag wrinkly. Sometimes cotton/linen/silk really holds in the sweat and makes you stink, or forms sweat stains on your pits, whereas there's loads of moisture wicking poly athletic clothing or super expensive technical gear for hiking or professional sports which is designed for a specific purpose from synthetic material that keeps you ultra dry, ultra cool, whatever it may be. Poly is also good UPF protection from the sun. Some of my most expensive hiking gear is made from polyester. There is some clothing I own, which I can toss in the washing machine, and after the spin cycle, it's completely dry, without the dry rack.   Acrylics can be super itchy and pilly, or be super tightly woven, soft, and incredibly durable. It really depends. You can't just look at the label and put it away because "omg ew polyester 100%" you need to touch it, stretch it, scrape your nail against it to see how the fabric performs.   tl;dr There's loads of great high quality fabrics in all materials whether it's natural fiber or man-made and I don't really have any negative opinion of anything until I see it in person, and touch it and wear it and I don't think it should matter at all, so long as you personally like it
text:I totally agree, but to be honest one caveat I find when shopping online is that if it's multiple materials that's usually (but not always) a sign of it being higher quality. 100% polyester is sketch unless it's like intended to be shiny sports-clothes material, but 99% polyester 1% something else is more likely to be a bit better for some reason	labels:Agree!

text:Bruce Boyer on Finding Your Wardrobe and Sustainability in Fashion ‚Äì Put This On (Derek Guy )	labels:i wish articles like this avoided the "expensive clothes sustainability" trope. the systems that lead to people being able to drop several thousand on a suit are inherently not sustainable, and i would love to see more discussion like that in the last question where consumption itself is addressed. imo the answer will involve more people taking responsibility for the origin of their own clothing with a focus on local labor and materials
text:Could you say more about why those systems are unsubstainablr?   I'm not very rich, I would struggle to afford a house in my expensive city, but I have dropped a few thousand on a suit - made with good materials by a local bespoke maker.  I think extreme wealth gaps are unsustainable, for sure, but dropping a few thousand on a suit every couple of years isn't much more than people spend on a computer, out drinking, or on games and gaming systems. For me, it's a hobby I get to wear.	labels:One decent suit in any closet is always a must, a couple of times I got the job I was interviewing for simply because I wore a suit and tie to the interview.   Sustainability and changing trends are another can of worms which depend on the individual. Contemporary vs Classic, $300 suit which can be altered by a tailor vs $4,000.00 fitted suit.

text:Thank all of you	labels:So a number of people are telling you not to buy a bunch of AE shoes because they are ‚Äúentry-level‚Äù and that you may eventually want to move up in price. This is true, but consider that anyone saying this has become a hobbyist who appreciates and collects high-end footwear, and therefore retroactively views AE as a gateway drug that led them to discover a new hobby. This implies a linear progression from spending $350 on shoes ‚Äî an amount 98% of men would find insane ‚Äî to eventually spending $1000+ on shoes, which is completely bonkers to all but a very small number of people.  Definitely wait a bit and avoid buying a dozen pairs of AEs too quickly. But also consider that if AE makes you happy and your goal is to amass a rotation of multiple good-quality shoes in different styles and colors, it‚Äôa perfectly acceptable to avoid leveling up. You don‚Äôt *have* to keep buying progressively more expensive stuff, and can instead enjoy what‚Äôs in a price tier you‚Äôre comfortable with.
text:This I think is where I am and thank you for the thoughts.   I need at least six pairs of shoes for daily wear. With that requirement I will soon have one pair of shoes that‚Äôs even the right size. So buying a stable of AE‚Äôs to get started seems reasonable.   I doubt I will ever really be a collector, and the idea of spending $1,000 for a pair of shoes still feels insane. But owning a base line of shoes that don‚Äôt hurt sounds well worth replacing my current shoes with AE‚Äôs even if there are other good options out there.	labels:check out preston on elegant oxford where he links a ebay sellar who lists AE for a fraction for what you would pay in store.

text:4SDesigns FW21	labels: 4S Designs is a relatively new brand, whose first collection was Fall-Winter 20 as things were going absolutely haywire in the world.  A lot of talent working for the brand, with the key designer being Angelo Urrutia. Angelo worked for the Nepenthes brands and Engineered Garments for god knows how many years (Through FW18 if I remember right?). Angelo is commonly known as Daiki's right-hand man, and from an outside perspective seems to have nearly as much influence in the brand's growth as Daiki has.   4s is definitely a different animal than EG. Still a workwear influence to be sure, but the styling is a little more conventional.   Fabrics are even crazier and much more lux than most of what EG has used - a lot of stuff that seems to be made special for the brand. Chanel-esque lurex-laden tweeds, soft and bulletproof melton, heavy twills, and ventile keep the choices interesting. Similar to EG, there have been many unconventional uses of fabrics.    While I don't think Angelo and team are aiming for the Conceptual collections ala Rick Owens, I think they nail an absolutely wearable aesthetic. Their lookbooks have been "different" but are one of the few brands that are unlikely to alienate people. With that, the details are still interesting enough to keep a normal enthusiast interested.	episode_done:True

A lot of companies that use these alternative materials are considered "premium" brands and carry their price tags accordingly.

text:Has anyone lost their wardrobe creativity as they‚Äôve gotten older? How do you get it back?	labels:I lost my fashion mojo for a few years after I had kids. I'm 34 now and I've realized that fast fashion doesn't work for me AT ALL, partly because stuff doesn't fit well anymore and also I don't have the time to browse and try on things in stores (even pre-pandemic I couldn't dedicate time for this). I've started buying less frequently but what I buy, I make sure it's good quality stuff that fits well and is decent quality. Not sure if it's age related but cheap items just don't look good on me anymore!  Same with skincare. I've started investing in quality skincare and it makes a difference.	episode_done:True

If yes to both then when your mother points that out again you say ‚Äúthank you I will take that into consideration‚Äù and move on. That‚Äôs how adults should talk and the whole point of being adults. You can share your opinion but I don‚Äôt have to follow your every word. Then you experiment with light colours yourself. Buying from thrift stores or online second hand apps sounds like a great place to start.

text:What are your 2021 Fashion / Style Goals?	labels:My style goals for 2021:  1. Be more creative with my style. I want to wear my more funky and unique pieces more often, and to make some of my pieces more personal by embroidering them with cool designs.   2. Shop my closet. I probably have about 60 pieces all together including accessories (I know this from my Stylebook app) and I‚Äôve realized that I can combine them in all sorts of new ways to create many different kinds of outfits.   2. Take videos of my crafted outfits. This has helped me a lot in seeing what is working on me and what needs a few tweaks. For example, I took a video of myself wearing a tucked in fitted turtleneck with high-waisted jeans and a belt. I felt it looked very nice in the mirror, but for some reason, it looked off in the video. I quickly realized that due to my height, my high-rise jeans weren‚Äôt hitting me at my natural waist, but were instead fitting closer to a mid rise. After noticing this, I experimented around with what I had, and settled on adding a unique 80‚Äôs jacket which made it look a lot more styled and proportionate.	episode_done:True

text:Walmart fashion a ‚Äúnew‚Äù thing as seen on IG bloggers?	labels:Are they marked as sponsored posts? A couple of fashion influencers I follow are showing a lot of Wal-Mart clothes these days and the posts are always marked as sponsored. Any time an influencer is getting paid to wear something I assume they're wearing it for that reason and not because they genuinely like the clothes. I'm always way more interested in what they're wearing when they're not getting paid by some megacorp.  I will say I have weird love for some of the older George (edit: from Wal-Mart) stuff (like from years ago) that I can find on ThredUp periodically, some of the dresses from 10 or so years ago are actually pretty great and wear well. Anything else I've ever seen or purchased is very meh.
text:The person I follow on IG (cheapchicfinds) is posting daily Walmart or target outfits and tagging them but it doesn‚Äôt say sponsored. I‚Äôm sure she‚Äôs gotta be getting something though.

text:Have you ever gone out on a limb and bought clothing from an unknown brand advertised on Instagram/Facebook/online? How did it work out?	labels:I‚Äôve had decent luck with my targeted ads. I almost use it to my advantage now. If I‚Äôm looking for something, I‚Äôll spend 5-10 minutes searching Google and browsing sites - then wait a few days. My Instagram will pop up with lots of places that I wouldn‚Äôt have necessarily found off Google but I am their target market.   Then I stalk. Check out the product reviews on their website, do a product review. com check, go into the tagged photos on Instagram to see people who are wearing the product and their feedback. Search comments! Companies not worth shopping with will have complaints under Insta photos or fake responses to their customers. Worse is no response to questions.   You can also find discount codes from their influencers on the tagged photos page that they wouldn‚Äôt necessarily share on their main page.   I‚Äôm a very cautious buyer. I need to have a good return policy if I‚Äôm shopping online from a company. So yes, I have a good experience but I put in a lot of prep into preparing my parachute before I jump.	episode_done:True

If you can‚Äôt do that, fold it and wrap it in washed, unbleached muslin fabric.   Make sure it is clean before you store it.  Perspiration and food spills can attract pests. If you hang it for display, do not place it in direct sunlight.  Also away from any source of moisture.

text:I recommend going to proper glasses store and talking to the product experts.  > a bit of curve so that I am shielded from the sides.  Unfortunately most, if not all, glasses that curve around to protect the sides are in that sports style.

I put this together from my existing wardrobe, since we didn't want to spend a lot. Covid measures made things a bit weird, but the court officer made a real effort into making it nice, which was great.

text:General Discussion - January 13, 2021	labels:The king is dead. Length is but a means to be longline or cropped or cuffed or stacked. All shoulders are raglan. Chest is where I put my delicate knits for safekeeping from the prying mouths of intrepid moths.    Measurements are pathetic quantifiers of a qualitative experience. The extra inches will drape from my anatomy pleasingly, like a banner proclaiming that fit's regime has been toppled dancing in the victorious breeze. M and L and 2 and 3 are guidance enough (S and 1 being made only for the woodland sprites who derive disgusting sustenance from their plentiful options on Y!JP).   While your tailor sleepily shaves another inconsequential centimeter from your shirt sleeve, mine envelop my hands, sheltering the delicate palmskin from the sear of a tea- filled mug. While you salve your chafed thighs from those jeans that "just need to break in", my pendulum swings within its harem, emancipated from the confines of low rises.   Will you hear the call of my silhouette, and learn how to breathe? Or will you continue to ride up the crevasses behind the aging corpse of the old king?   The post-fit era is upon us.

text:I'm not arguing over it at all, though, I'm just using it as a lens. I focus on quality details, and then tell myself, oh, okay, I'm paying an extra 30% for syling? Or oh, this isn't exactly what I had in mind, but it's 80% cheaper than it should be? Hmmm...  There are a ton of factors left to consider, and I make each decision on a case-by-case basis. I'm not trying to calculate anything. But I find this lens very helpful.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:General Discussion - October 19	labels:Looking into my crystal ball, predictions for the future of fashion:  Like, 10 years from now some dumb brand is going to try to pull a Margiela on "MAGA" hats and appropriate them as part of a seasonal collection, altering them to turn them into a different piece, like painting the logo across the front so that it partly covers the text. The collection will largely be shot down as "too soon."  On the flipside though like 25 years from now I could imagine edgy hipsters appropriating them as their own form of "ironic" fashion. Ageing millennials will condemn it as inappropriate but the youth culture will only cling to it harder as being "subversive," in part perhaps because they don't fully grasp the cultural context of the late 2010s, a period they weren't even alive during.

Why do so many men hold the sentiment that ‚Äúdressing up‚Äù equates to being uncomfortable? I just went to a Christmas service at an employee‚Äôs rural church where everyone wears jeans or other 5 pocket pants and oxfords. No problem with that at all, but 4 or 5 people made comments about my slacks/shirt/tie/bomber jacket/boots(he said be casual...I still over dressed with the tie) with things like ‚Äúman I‚Äôm glad someone can wear those‚Äù.   Who hurt these people? Are teenage men being put in some awful $99 suits and being traumatized? I have never worn less than a decent department store suit so maybe I am blind to struggles of others, but even a $300 department store suit is quite comfortable. Nothing compared to 100% wool tailored pants that feel like amazing pajamas, but still comfortable compared to jeans.
text:Generations of men have been taught that dressing up or caring about your appearance is feminine/gay/effete etc. Combine  this with the USA‚Äôs near idiot  savant level obsession with dressing casually it‚Äôs no wonder wearing anything but jeans can elicit these reactions.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:How do men's outerwear differ from women's? I found a really good deal on a 100% wool coat, but in men's...	labels:I would check out Aritzia for wool coats. I think right now they're on sale for more or less 200 dollars and they're made from Italian wool.   Otherwise, I would highly suggest getting the size as close to you as possible and consider getting it tailored--especially if you intend to get a nice coat that lasts a long time. I think it's definitely worth the money tailoring nice clothes to your body!
text:A word of caution about tailoring - it‚Äôs the shoulders that will most likely need tailoring, but it is very difficult and very expensive to alter shoulders on a coat, and may not be physically possible depending on how much you need them taken in.   I tried it once with a men‚Äôs peacoat and brought it to the best, most experienced tailor in town, and even he really struggled with it. In the end, he could not take the shoulders in far enough without ruining the structure of the coat. He did the best possible job he could, it was not at all his fault, but it cost a lot and I didn‚Äôt really like the result.	labels:This is very true, And another problem is the size of the armhole. The armholes tend to be very big on men's coats, and no tailoring can actually add in fabric to make the size more reasonable. A man's coat would have armholes halfway to the waist on me, which greatly reduces the arm range of motion.
text:Yes, I had this issue with my coat too! It‚Äôs one of the reasons I didn‚Äôt like the result... the sleeves ended up looking really disproportionate, and not in a cool, intentional way.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:What does your shoe wardrobe look like? What are your shoe essentials?	labels:I‚Äôm definitely a shoe hoarder. I‚Äôve got over 30 pairs that cover a wide variety of styles - boots (tall or short), heels (from work-practical to 6+‚Äù party shoes), flats, sandals, running shoes, etc. I‚Äôm also 5‚Äô2‚Äù so if something is cute and has a heel, I‚Äôll buy it.  My essentials probably boil down to a pair of black lace-up ankle boots, at least one pair of neutral, sensible heels for work, and a pair of casual flat sneakers that I can dress up or down. These are the items that I default to when I‚Äôm not feeling brave about shoes, and the items I always replace when they wear out.  I tend to buy cheaper shoes because I like having that kind of variety. I have a couple of pairs of more expensive shoes that are significantly better quality for when I want to hold on to them for a while. I find it‚Äôs a lot easier for me to be adventurous with shoes than with the rest of my wardrobe, and I‚Äôm less likely to feel self-conscious if I try something new. This post does remind me though that I need to clean out my closet...	episode_done:True
text:Favorite unconventional workwear?	labels:I have some shiny pants I wear! I find they are a bit better with something covering my butt, so I usually wear them with a cool printed button down + blazer or a long sweater and ankle boots. One pair is sort of a disco pant, one is actually a disco pant and one is a pair of faux leather leggings. Definitely toes the line but my manager is one of those ladies who clinks when she walks because of how much jewelry she wears and she has tons of visible tattoos, so I think I am good!	episode_done:True

text:General Discussion - November 30, 2020	labels:<rant>  If I said "Wear cropped jackets so you look taller" I'd be laughed out of the room but somehow "Short people shouldn't wear long coats" is a valid thing?   Also what's defined as short? If someone is 5'7" do they get to wear long coats? What if they're 5'7.5"??  It also throws the idea out the window of the whole horizontal breaks thing that people complain about for cropped trousers or high-waisted pants. Suddenly you have a wonderful garment type that can give you long, **tall**, and elegant lines and it's impossible to wear.   People complain all the damn time about menswear being too "restrictive" and women's wear being more "exciting" but everyone is too much of a wimp to wear a ~ L O N G C O A T ~.  I fucking hate fashion "rules" and "guidelines" and literally everything having to do with the word "flattering". If you care so much about these gender norms, masculinity and being ~ flattering ~ then sack up and wear the clothes you like.   That whole thread is just people saying that someone else told them they couldn't *wear a coat* so what should they do? Oh idk. How about tell them to fuck off and wear the damn coat.  </rant>

How woefully unprepared they are for this entirely predictable coup is baffling to me.
text:I‚Äôll be honest I just think it‚Äôs really funny that the right is probably going to tout this as some giant win lol.  Like, the capitol building is not that difficult to get into and apparently the only people present were DC metro police; which are basically just glorified mall cops. Not to mention the venn diagram of cops and trump supporters is pretty close to a circle so I doubt anyone had much of a vested interest in stopping them.  It‚Äôs like babies first coup attempt, get back to us when you burn down a police precinct	labels:I'm done thinking it's funny personally. I thought I was going to type more but I'm so done.   So many systemic failures. If this was a BLM protest there would be dozens of people dead and/or hospitalized. I'm disgusted.
text:I can def understand that, it‚Äôs a pretty gross show of police bias at best	labels:	episode_done:True
text:How do you actually incorporate colour in your wardrobe?	labels:I think an important question you should ask yourself before just trying to incorporate color is  are you actually dissatisfied with neutrals/does color really inspire you? I think the biggest reason I wear color is because when I look at it, it makes me happy, it inspires me to want to wear pieces, and I get excited shopping for it.   In looking for color to incorporate in with your neutrals, I would just first find out what colors you feel drawn to - sure maybe some you‚Äôll find will be things you like, but maybe aren‚Äôt the most ‚Äúflattering‚Äù or versatile, but I still think that‚Äôs a good place to start, because fashion should be fun.   As far as practical advice, wearing color is a lot easier when you have neutrals to pair it with. I tend to wear one bright color/color family with neutral tones and tie it in also with my accessories. Things like earrings or accessories can be good places to introduce color if you are feeling nervous about it as well.  Also, learning about the color wheel and the undertones of colors can be really useful for color matching.	episode_done:True
text:What ultimate-splurge fashion item would you buy to reward yourself for achieving a big milestone?	labels:Probably a Cartier Tank or Panthere watch.  I love the little Fossil watch that my husband bought me four years ago; but something about it is getting wonky, like it'll stop and start randomly and the second hand has fallen off twice.  It might be time to invest in a "forever watch" in the near future.     Edit:  The ultimate spurge would be a Chanel classic flap for my mom.  When I was in law school (and pretty broke), I gave my mom two Chanel lipsticks for Christmas and wrote in the card:  one day, this will be a bag.

Basically the only thing that made me going to work bearable was the possibility of getting a package. I am in a much better place now and while I still buy stuff online, usually EBay, it‚Äôs much more reasonable and thoughtful (only stuff I need & I resell/donate what I don‚Äôt). When I was in the Bad Job, I had no doubt shopping that maniacally was not normal but I just couldn‚Äôt see another way. (Til I quit!)

text:How Japan's Best Men‚Äôs Magazines Gained a Cult Following in the US	labels:I love these magazines for their pictures and some articles, but I always felt a lot of them just end up being big ads for their friends stores/brands. Many of the ones made by the same publisher like Clutch, 2nd, Go Out, Lightning also just focus on buying with some short flowery description of the product and not much else. I‚Äôd like to see more stuff that involves lifestyle, articles, and stuff. Although it makes sense that the lack of this has brought in more readers from the west, more product pictures and less blocks of text. I also understand that the magazines scopes are limited so therefore they must retread the same discussions over and over.  Also the fact that Go Outs focuses mostly on glamping (glam camping, it was a top searched word in Japan last year) kills me as some one who loves outdoor stuff. It doesn‚Äôt have much in the way of actual camping, just setting up huge luxurious tents in an open field for the most part.  Maybe I‚Äôm just salty because all the magazines show cool stores but all of them are in Tokyo while never here in Kyoto.	episode_done:True

text:What is your favorite clothing/accessories subscription box?	labels:I got free Stitchfix credit from a friend, so I've used Stitchfix a couple of times. (disclaimer: I haven't tried anything else). I was very specific about my body type in the profile section, and after the first box I was very specific to the stylist about what types of clothes I wanted to try and what I didn't like. There's also a small extra info box on your profile where you can mention specifics, e.g. looking for more business casual pieces, would never wear X things, live in a warm climate, etc.      I think styling services like Stitchfix work best when you know yourself well‚Äî for example, I'm petite, proportionally really short legs, and I know what doesn't work for me (animal prints, dots, shift dresses, low heels). I specifically noted items that I felt like had a low chance of success in terms of fit (e.g. jeans, blazers) and casual items (not worth the $$) as items that I did not want to receive.     The more specific you can be, the better a box you'll get. This does mean that you're less likely to need the help of a stylist to find pieces for you, but it can be fun to try on things you wouldn't have picked up on your own.	episode_done:True
text:Your Go-To Tee Is Actually a Turtleneck	labels:Not tried turtleneck tees but I own a couple of turtleneck sweaters (a thin merino from uniqlo and a thicker one from H&M) and even the thinnest one is too warm. I only wear them as an alternative to a scarf if I know I'm going to be outside all day and it's freezing cold. As soon as I go inside it's just _too_ hot, I feel like I'm going to pass out. It's like wearing a winter jacket and scarf in a sauna.
text:me too. prefer a turtleneck tee over a sweater now. In the long run the collar in a turtleneck sweater loses shape somewhat quickly and gets limp as it is a knit.  I also became lazier in maintaining sweaters as they lose shape easily and need more delicate washing.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Women who have revamped your entire wardrobe ‚Äî how did that go? What is your advice for the rest of us?	labels:I found myself at age 27 having lost every good pieces I ever owned, had gained 32 lbs, and was wearing the same two pairs of leggings from Ross basically every day. I‚Äôm 32 going on 33 now and have built a beautiful new style, I don‚Äôt have everything, but a lot of great wearable pieces.  My advice is to start with what you‚Äôre missing in that moment, and buy ahead for the season when you can.   Do not try to buy everything at once!  Pay close attn to materials (what you like vs. don‚Äôt) and remember to look for that when shopping online. Things that will last and are versatile.   Accessories are fun ü§© invest in pants shoes and bags and jewelry!  Don‚Äôt just buy things because they are on sale, be thoughtful about what you‚Äôre choosing.   Do not be afraid to buy things oversized!  I was so afraid to up size for so long that I ended up with tshirts I never wear sweatpants sweatshirts, jackets etc. even SHOES!   Which brings me to my last point, remember to bring socks when trying on boots!  Xoxo üòò	episode_done:True

text:Winter jackets that are good for skiing and casual use?	labels:Dont go crazy on a jacket.  The key for skiing is layers and you can get a lot of layers that work well in other settings.   A decent base layer:  you can go merino or if you are on a budget milsurp poly pro.  A fleece over that.  Next layer is a beefier jacket.  Right now I have a half zip Patagonia that is poly insulated.  Then get a waterproof(ish) layer.  You have a lot of options but I usually run with a marmot precip.  It's cheap, has pit zips and folds up way smaller than a hard shell. That combo will cover you skiing 90%of the time and let you adjust depending o N conditions. Flexibility is the key.  Take the money you save and get some good socks and gloves/mittens and some type of balaclava.  No one ever came off of the mountain because their chest was cold but it was their hands/feet/face.
text:If you live in the PNW a goretex or good waterproof layer shell is key, I got one finally for this season and man it‚Äôs amazing not to be soaked by the end. And all that‚Äôs needed under that is layering. But gotetex jackets aren‚Äôt exactly cheap.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:And that may very well be. My idea for wanting to set up a capsule wardrobe was because in the last 5 years, I've moved 7 times, so I'm trying to keep my clothing as little as possible. With a capsule wardrobe, I can have, say, 20-30 pieces and 50+ outfits with them instead of having 20-30 pieces of non-matching color schemes and having maybe 20 outfits.	labels:I feel like I'm just being an enabler here, but I've moved 10 (!) times in the past 7 years and what takes up the most room isn't clothes -- it's shoes! So if you can pare down your shoe collection to go with most of your clothes I think you wouldn't have trouble having a large-ish wardrobe.
text:That makes sense! I should have clarified, this time I'm moving to the other hemisphere so I have a suitcase worth of space and a carry-on to pack all of my life into, so my space will be extremely limited!

text:Bruce Boyer on Finding Your Wardrobe and Sustainability in Fashion ‚Äì Put This On (Derek Guy )	labels:i wish articles like this avoided the "expensive clothes sustainability" trope. the systems that lead to people being able to drop several thousand on a suit are inherently not sustainable, and i would love to see more discussion like that in the last question where consumption itself is addressed. imo the answer will involve more people taking responsibility for the origin of their own clothing with a focus on local labor and materials
text:In the interview Boyer mentions buying a custom three-piece flannel suit around 1965 for $125 ‚Äî which would be $1,027 in 2020 dollars. That‚Äôs obviously quite a bit less than a similar piece would cost on Savile Row today, but it‚Äôs not like that was a cheap piece for a recent college grad at the time. I don‚Äôt know all the ins and outs around why the cost of tailored clothing rose faster than inflation, but I suspect it has a lot to do with the casualization of the Western wardrobe sharply reducing the demand for both bespoke clothing and its inputs (like wool), which meant the industry couldn‚Äôt profit from volume.  Inflation in particular seems to be an element people have difficulty mentally grappling with over time. If a guy grows up thinking a pair of jeans should cost $50, he‚Äôs likely to consider anything more than that outrageous even decades later, when the money is worth 3x less. I think this is an under-appreciated element of the race to the bottom in our clothing ‚Äî it‚Äôs not just that Instagram encourages everyone to wear different clothes in every picture, it‚Äôs also that we‚Äôre conditioned to think price tags should never increase over time. The clothes most people wear every day are significantly cheaper than they used to be in real terms, and that was only made possible by using cheaper labor and cheaper materials.	labels:Furthermore, that generation wasn't really bothered by inflation, as the wages were generally keeping up with it. But since the late 70s, early 80s, wages have stagnated for most. I think this is the reason most people cannot justify saving for a higher quality item. Good quality garments nowadays are keep getting further out of reach for most.	episode_done:True

Edit to add: My husband is a furrier, if that helps your decision.  Edit again to add: I may also be a lot older than the woman with the spotted dogs and have a red and black roadster and no husband, depending.
text:NTA! If that woman doesn‚Äôt want people commenting on how good of a coat her dogs would make she shouldn‚Äôt have them! It sounds like she might be abusing them by her reaction.

text:General Discussion - December 13, 2020	labels:The long comment thread below got me thinking.   I feel like we live in a time where dozens of fashion subcultures are able to exist at once. I've never seen so many designers and brands across several "genres" all thriving so well.  Saying something isn't "in fashion" just seems wild to me right now. Because honestly I think what's "fashionable" is exploring your own personal style and aesthetic. Being yourself is what's currently cool, and I think that's dope.
text:Sometimes I wonder how of this is bias towards the present.   There definitely have been large scale trends lately: notably luxury streetwear, which is starting to ebb (Virgil Abloh, Kim Jones, and Jerry Lorenzo have all been trying to pivot to tailoring lately).  Sure, not everybody has been on the streetwear train, but not everybody in the past marched in trendy lockstep either. We think of the eighties as pretty homogenous, but football shoulder *Wall Street* tailoring, prep, punk, and new wave were all happening at the same time, Issey Miyake was in the middle of his career and Comme and Yohji were getting their starts. If you were living in the middle of that and you cared about fashion, you probably wouldn't think there was just one trendy thing at a time either.   Maybe in 2060 we'll all be looking back on the 10s as The Streetwear Era and think that trends are just at that moment starting to die.	labels:I was gonna say something similar but you put it much better than I would have hahaha.

text:What's been your experience with men's stores/departments?	labels:My partner shops in the men's section and hasn't had any issues, to my knowledge.   Brands that have worked include Lucky brand (especially for jeans), Banana Republic (boxer briefs and button-downs), and I think American Eagle (t-shirts, maybe shorts I think). I'll try to think of others.   They've also had a lot of luck at a certain local thrift store that carries a lot of menswear, which admittedly can be tricky to find and is especially challenging during a pandemic. That's a great way to find out what brands and styles work best for your body though: try out a ton of different ones.   Consider if there are any ways to access hand-me-downs from friends for this, too - my friends had a lot of clothing swaps in the before times and lots of my queer friends wear or used to wear men's clothes. If not your friends, there may be groups in your area that share or trade clothes. And on that note, regardless of your own identity, you might find some other ideas online by looking at queer fashion resources online.   Regarding the brands I've mentioned above, my partner's physique is relatively long and lean, so take this advice with a grain of salt if you are plus sized and/or generally have curvier proportions. For example, I'm close in size to them or possibly even a bit smaller right now, but I am smaller on top than on the bottom. That's pretty inconvenient for men's clothes, so I would probably need to shop a bit differently. There are definitely plus-sized and curvy queer bloggers out there who look awesome in menswear wardrobes, so hopefully you can find some inspiration about how to make menswear work for your shape.   Finally... If you have the funds, there are definitely custom options available. My partner got a custom suit for our wedding, including some tailored shirts. You can also get off the rack clothes tweaked by a tailor, which is probably something I would want to do.	episode_done:True

text:Hedi Slimane‚Äôs CELINE- an idealized look at 1960s rock & roll (large inspiration album)	labels:Love the inspiration folder, showing the clear influences and understanding of Celine under Slimane.  I do really enjoy Celine before Dancing Kid, but the latest collection wasn‚Äôt targeted to me.  The Dancing Kid is really to appeal to a new generation of buyers, when the past collections were to appeal to people who knew him as a designer.  I do like Dancing Kid though as a collection, I think it fits in with his more androgynous side that used to be more common with his days at Dior.  But it‚Äôll be interesting to see where the brand goes post S/S 21 because I honestly don‚Äôt know what will happen.  I personally love the style and influences he had for Celine pre Dancing Kid.  As a kid who grew up watching French New Wave and listening to music from the British Invasion, I can definitely see myself transitioning to wearing clothes like that when I get back into an office.  It‚Äôll always look cool.
text:I completely agree with your assessment- there is not a lot from The Dancing Kid that is cohesive through his earlier collections, but also recognize that it was calculated to broaden the appeal of the Label beyond Hedi devotees. I'm very excited to see what the FW21 show will look like, and if it extends the Dancing Kid, or goes back to his more historic influences.	labels:	episode_done:True

I never have to think too much about what I wear and I don't really have to make any decisions after I purchase the item. My dresses are really comfortable, all of them have pockets, and I get compliments constantly. Uniform dressing sounds really boring, but you can create a fun and unique type of uniform if you want.  I tried a capsule wardrobe earlier this summer. It had dresses, shirts, pants and shorts, but I went back just dresses because the capsule was too many decisions. I just pick a dress that is clean and move on with my day, but I also still have a distinct and unique style.

For an evening dress I‚Äôll spend $$$ for good quality, design, etc.   I just bought a $400 leather jacket.   So I guess the answer is it just depends!

text:Jeans: Recommendations and Reviews	labels:Honestly I think you have to give way more detail on your old pair and what you‚Äôre looking for.  In my mind the biggest hurdle to perfect jeans is the fit, and since every body is different this is highly individual. Some people might prefer stretchier denim for a more forgiving fit, while others look for stiffer fabric, and have less leeway.   Personally I still struggle to find a high rise, non cropped, fits my thighs and waist, plain dark wash, straight/skinny, 90% or more cotton, pair of jeans. But hopefully I‚Äôll find it eventually!

text:What are your most loved ride-or-die winter clothing items?	labels:How fun to hear how different places make such a difference in what you need for winter! Great question, as we are having snow as we speak! Winter here (inter mountain west US) lasts til April when we might see the ground again, so warm, wind proof and dry are key attributes for clothing for keeping you alive and well. We like Sorel boots with the heavy felt liners for below zero outdoor activities. But since they‚Äôre lighter LLBean insulated boots for snowshoeing and general wear around town . Inside the house  the warmest footwear is Hafflinger felt clogs. Socks we use heavy wool blend Darn Tough. All of these items last a long time so worth the money. Since we‚Äôre both retired we don‚Äôt have to gussy up much so I only need one or two warm  long skirts for church. He likes Duluth work jeans and plaid flannel shirts and always a ball cap on his head. I have a couple of fleece jackets (Columbia) and 2 Orvis cashmere sweaters that were on sale 2 years ago. For me under the sweaters I like 3/4 or short sleeve t-shirts . Neither of us likes turtle neck shirts. Our outdoor coats are: his Columbia and mine Jack Wolfskin both with integrated hood. A surprisingly warm kind of gloves is Kinko work gloves. They come in mittens as well as regular gloves, but need to be waterproofed before shoveling snow. They are very reasonable in price and sturdy. If it‚Äôs below zero and blowing out a nice wool scarf to protect your face.

text:'Silk and Steel' NPR Article Discussion	labels:Interesting article. US urbanite perspective here, as I feel that‚Äôs important to state.   ‚ÄúClothing is the barometer of change‚Äù   It‚Äôs interesting to think about the roots of what we now consider ‚Äúclassic pieces‚Äù, only coming from the last century. It makes me think about what changes we will see moving forward, and how classics may shift with shifting norms.   When I think about French fashion as a whole, as diverse as it it, the dominant idea is that of the Parisian bobo woman, a bit undone but thoroughly classic. Neutral colors (described as dye shortage, and also mourning),pops of color (described as identifying with a political allegiance) trench coats (wartime utilitarian piece) a nice wrist watch (wartime utilitarian piece). Clear connections. The roots are there. It makes sense. And practical! Don‚Äôt pull out your phone on the metro if you don‚Äôt have to, check your watch instead. Protect yourself from the urban grime and constant wet with blacks and greys and throw on a trench.   Import that idea and it‚Äôs further diluted. Current urban dressing has been reduced and simplified and given a new context. Along with increased production and lower quality, it feels so disconnected to me. Think about a flimsy fashion trench coat, or a thin pair of combat boots. Hollow, right? Think about a robust trench coat or thick, protective combat boots. A little excessive for hopping on a train or an uber to dinner, no?   I‚Äôm longing for clothing that aligns with my utilitarian needs again. I‚Äôll reluctantly say, for now, long live loungewear!	episode_done:True

text:What are the pros and cons of dressing the way that you do?	labels:Well, I'm a lesbian with long hair and traditionally feminine clothes.   Pro: People assume I'm straight. This means I don't get the constant judgment that comes with looking visibly queer (unlike my fianc√©e, who we joke is a "50 footer" because you can tell she's a lesbian from 50 feet away). I work in healthcare and live in a politically mixed area, and everyone is automatically friendly to me.   Con: People assume I'm straight. So if I mention my fianc√©e people assume she's male, and if her pronouns come up I have to have this whole awkward interaction where (at best) they go "Oh--she??? Ohhhhh" and then look me up and down, awkwardly change the subject or ask me invasive questions, and stop being so friendly with me. Also, men hit on me, and women never hit on me.

One lucky day, I was in the cafeteria with my friends and eating lunch, I decided to check it again. And it was back, only one piece, and in my size! You can guess how fast I clicked the order button.  My second best miracle was finding black Dr. Martens at TK Maxx for only 50‚Ç¨ (they sell for about 200‚Ç¨ usually).

While for normal woven ties, I'd usually reach for a navy over a black, with the texture of a silk knit, somehow the black knit tie just looks better than the navy knit in so many outfits.   This might be a function of bias because I've read articles extolling the virtues of the black knit tie, but I think the texture of the knit helps to offset the starkness of the colour

text:I know ‚Äúfashion‚Äù but people of minorities are always forced to try better. Some Insights	labels:As a black man I'm not surprised by this at all. I don't think I'm as affected as most because my clothes are overtly fashionable and often feminine, and that tends to disarm any preconceptions of "dangerous" and "violent". But I see it all the time, and I do notice a difference on the rare occasions I just dress plainly. Before Covid, if I walked home from the gym at night in sweats I wouldn't put my hood up or my hands in my pockets because I walked by one of campus police's favorite sitting spots. We only need to look at Trayvon Martin for confirmation. One note about the study:  > While it is tempting to tell individuals that how they dress can evoke negative biases, this avoids addressing a bigger issue ‚Ä¶ In fact, directing individuals to change what they wear places the burden of mitigating stereotypes and associated prejudices on the wearer. Instead, we need to consider how we can change the perceptions of those who hold and use such stereotypes in harmful ways.  I agree and I appreciate the sentiment, but I'll be dead before we change racists' perceptions on this. It's not a burden I or any other black man should have to carry, but realistically it's a lot easier for me to change my clothes than for a racist to change their thinking.  ETA: Black women have it way worse. They get to have racism **and** misogyny!

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - January 18, 2021	labels:For context, I'm 19 and I recently bought around $500 worth of clothes for black friday and this is the first time I've ever gone shopping for clothes for myself on a large scale.  Instead of looking for fashion trends I just looked for clothes that I thought would look good on me.  As my clothes got delivered, I tried them all on and was really happy with the way I looked.   But, recently something happened that made me very self-conscious about what I wear in public.  I was at a kickback with a couple of my friends, and a girl I didn't know walked up to me after I was done playing chess with my friend.  The first thing she said to me was "is that your boyfriend?"  This was a very weird situation for me because the first interaction I have with this person is already bad.  I say "No, I'm straight," and she replies "Oh, I thought you were gay."  I asked her why she thought I was gay and she told me it was because of my outfit.  Then she asks to play a game of chess against me and I didn't want to be unpleasant so I accepted.  The entire 15 minutes of that chess game I wanted it to be over because of how fucked the situation was. I was wearing jeans, a striped shirt, and a tan blazer.  I also frequently wear silver stud earrings, nothing too blingy.  This experience really hurt me because I'm a very self-conscious person.  I really enjoy being comfortable in what I'm wearing, and this has made me reconsider what to wear in public.   Are there any fashion styles I should enjoy if I want to avoid being titled as gay?  Or should I just keep wearing what I want to wear? I'd say that my personality and the way that I speak is a clear indication that I am straight, I'm just worried about people judging me before they meet me (because clearly that happens).
text:For a second lets remove the problematic conversation of looking "gay" or acting "straight", we can circle back to that in a moment.  Lets talk about context and clothes and bad habits we all have. When we start to do something new, we often over correct and this can be problematic in our personal lives. A lot of people will start their style journey and go a bit too fast and a bit too hard, styling themselves for an aspirational goal or lifestyle and ignoring where they are and what they're doing. Obviously you should dress how yourself however you feel, but then you've got to be willing to deal with people's reactions to your choices. So what do you do? Making sure your clothes aren't sending a message that doesn't vibe with the rest of your situation. You're 19 and wearing a tan blazer for a kickback with your friends, that's a bold look. In fact wearing a sports coat is super hard to do nowadays in a casual setting, it's almost immediately assumed to be "dressed up". Your peer group might not understand your new interest, but keep at it and being a little bit more stylish will become your thing. I still get teased for how much I like clothing, the number of shoes in the shoe rack, knits in the drawers - wearing chinos when everyone else is wearing sweatpants - that's life.  Now...I want to be really clear about this: There's no correct way to be Gay or Straight, a person's mannerisms, voice, personality, clothing is not dictated by their sexuality. The sooner you come to accept and understand that, the easier ride you're going to have in life and you'll be a better person. Neither is there anything wrong with being assumed to be gay, straight, bisexual, trans, queer, etc. it speaks to the other person more than it speaks to you. Be an Ally.   Finally, I understand that the world isn't awesome and that in some situations it can be dangerous for someone to think you're anything other than Straight. If you're in that situation, or around those people...stop, find new people, find new situations.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:How do some people put outfits together so effortlessly. Fashionista's please help.	labels:Hi! Former stylist.  1) Pay attention to the fit of things and figure out what cuts and shapes look good on you. Paper bag pants and some joggers have similar fits. Some mini skirts and shorts hit the same place on your legs and can have the same waist height. Find your sweet spot and don‚Äôt be afraid to buy multiple things in silhouettes that work for you.   2) Get some statement pieces that you would die for. If you are wearing a pair of jeans that fit well and a t-shit purchased within the past 3 years with some awesome earrings you going to look and feel great. If you are wearing an amazing dress and simple white sneakers you are going to look and feel great. Don‚Äôt overthink things but try and wear at LEAST one piece you are excited about at a time.   3) Don‚Äôt buy things just cause they are on sale, you saw your friend wearing it, or you feel like you ‚Äúneed‚Äù something in your wardrobe. You should love everything in your closet in its own special way unless it‚Äôs workwear and you hate your dress code for work. Something as simple as a T-shirt has so many different factors like cut, material, neckline, sleeve length. Purchase what feels good and don‚Äôt bother with the rest.

text:Marilyn Monroe: Casual Style and Dressing for Men	labels:Definitely misogynistic and sexist, but it‚Äôs also the 1950s so that makes sense. I‚Äôm sure Marilyn herself didn‚Äôt realize that she was unconsciously being sexist and contributing to the problems that she (and other women) were facing. It‚Äôs kind of sad in a way when you think about it.
text:I think Marilyn was very conscious of what she was doing here. She carried a folksy persona, deliberately catering to working men and women, and had that "What do you mean by suspecting I'm dressing sexy by wearing dresses so tight they have to be sewn on, I can't help that I'm CURVY! It is those who think it's on purpose that are truly lewd!!"-vibe all the way through.   Basically, she tried to be as sexy as possible, but because that wasn't really allowed due to misogyny, she tried and mostly succeeded to pass it off as pure innocence. Here she is saying "I just want to please you guys, it's only natural - why do you judge me for being feminine? Men like feminine women bla bla" in an attempt to make the media be less judgmental about her livelihood.   She wasn't treated respectfully even though she was a huge star, because even though Holywood wanted a woman who was first and foremost sexy, they also judged and shamed the stars for trying to be exactly that. No wonder she was defensive about it - she lived up to the ideal the most, so she also had to be the spokesperson and defender of it. She was very much aware of her image.	labels:I think I didn‚Äôt properly explain what I meant. Her saying that ‚Äúonly women criticize what I wear‚Äù is very similar to the things that ‚Äúoh I‚Äôm not like other women‚Äù  or ‚ÄúI only hang out with the guys‚Äù type of women say. Women like this tend to have internalized misogyny that they are not conscious of, and they continue to contribute to this societal problem by trying to put down other women while elevating themselves.   It‚Äôs sad because she suffers from exactly the problem that she is contributing to. I don‚Äôt think she had some ‚Äúevil‚Äù thoughts or ‚Äúconnived‚Äù behind the scenes - in fact I believe from her personal life (and from people that knew her), she was a very sweet girl who was quite naive (which you can kind of tell based on how her relationships often went).   Also I don‚Äôt believe she had control over what she could wear while on set or that very famous JFK dress. Her stylist probably styled her and she had little to no input into her outfits.
text:That's funny, I have also read an absurd amount of litterate on MM, and I have the exact opposite thoughts of her. I think she was a very smart business woman, who knew how to play the game - I don't think being sweet and naive would carry you to the top in 1950's Hollywood. Especially not when she started off as an orphan with nothing to her name.    That being said, I don't think being conniving when you work in the entertainment industry, is evil or anything. I think it's really hard (actually impossible) to project an image as consistently as she did, without being incredibly self aware. She could have internalized misogyny, but she could have also played the "cool girl" in order to win approval.	labels:She definitely knew how to play the game and did it pretty well for a while.	episode_done:True

Now, I'm actually dressing more my age as opposed to for a future career: oversize, bright & colorful pieces, interesting necklines and clashing prints. Honestly, it's been a big 180\` and I kinda love it tbh. What's more fun is on days when i feel like dressing up, I combine the two styles and look very ManRepeller circa 2018, or Kdrama fashion.

text:How would you describe the quality of self-knit/self-made clothes vs. store bought?	labels:I am a sewist with just over 1 year if experience, and my handmade clothes are without a doubt better quality than fast fashion store bought, comparable or better than mid-range (ie I always fully line things, I use French seams or bias bound seams and hand picked zippers rather than overlocker seam finishes as you get in almost all store bought clothes) and I wouldn't know about high end because I don't shop anywhere that fancy. The difference for me is I now spend the money on high quality fabric - organic cotton, 100% sandwashed linen, hemp and bull denim, tencel and lyocell blends etc. Often even mid to higher end clothes are not made with the highest quality natural fibers and it really makes a difference in wear and tear. I also use good quality thread which makes a big difference. Because I only sew for myself, I can take as long as I want doing beautiful seam finishes, fitting garments correctly, and more. My home sewn clothes get worn daily and I have to admit its really ruined shopping for me, even op shopping, because now my standards for fit, fabric and finish are quite high. I'm in no way a professional, simply someone who loves to sew and feels she deserves the clothes of her dreams. I do treat my clothing kindly though - I wash less, hang dry and repair or repurpose what I can.	episode_done:True

That way I can see if it actually looks good on people who aren‚Äôt tall and thin or if it‚Äôs one of those things where it‚Äôs designed specifically for that fashion model body type. It‚Äôs been really helpful for me in figuring out what I can and can‚Äôt ‚Äúpull off.‚Äù	episode_done:True
text:Stealing her style: Nicole Kidman as "Grace Fraser" in "The Undoing"	labels:I'm usually not a fan of "Boho" as it tends to make me think of festival wear but these looks are very luxe and grown up. I love that fuchsia suede skirt you've got on in one of your photos.
text:Thank you! I think her outfits are actually quite classic (tailored coats, pencil skirts, blouses, loafers,..) but the contrasting rich colors and the sumptuous textures are what bring a bohemian vibe. Also her beautiful ginger curls..	labels:The colors are fantastic, agreed! Adding: I had another look at the looks you put together and those plum leather gloves are also genius. Well done!	episode_done:True
text:How much of your income do you spend on average in clothes every month?	labels:I spend about 3-4% (~$250/month) of my take home income on clothes. It would probably be around 7-8% if handbags and shoes were included.   I‚Äôm in my late 20s and fortune enough to be making a pretty good income. It‚Äôs totally normal to be spending a lot less when you‚Äôre in college! Some students have parental help with finances or spend their money from part time work on clothes. Don‚Äôt feel pressured to spend money on clothes when you have other priorities that come first (like school, rent, food, savings).	episode_done:True
text:What are some habits that keep clothes/shoes new vs that habits that ruin them?	labels:First for cardigans and sweaters is I either go fully wool or fully cotton. Can‚Äôt be any sort of blend, and I avoid mohair. I have a cotton cardigan from urban outfitters that‚Äôs like 5-6 years old and looks brand new, so you don‚Äôt even need to go super pricey, just look at fabric content.  Second is I wash everything on cold, and hang dry as often as possible. Heat basically transforms fabric, so using it is unnecessary. I also find that it sets pit stains instead of removes them.  Shoes I have no idea. I walk a lot and constantly wear out shoes. I find leather with a sewn in sole lasts a lot longer, but flats and heels never last that long. I‚Äôve also had luck with shoes that have wooden soles which I‚Äôve added a sole with traction to.  For bags, I‚Äôve always heard it‚Äôs bad luck to keep them on the ground, but that‚Äôs more superstition than keeping it nice lol.
text:Lol I‚Äôve heard that superstition too. My ex was Turkish and that‚Äôs what his mom said, so I assumed it was a Turkish thing.   But I don‚Äôt keep my bags on the ground, because the ground is nasty. Why people put their LV never fulls on the floor befuddles me.   My beautiful YSL leather bag that I saved up for months working hard: She pretty. She sits on the table or the designated purse chair.   I also moisturize my leather products once a month or so. I‚Äôll clean them too if needed.   As far as clothes, it helps tremendously to hang dry, hand wash or machine wash on delicate cold.   Shoes: moisturizer every month. Take in to the cobbler once the season is over, store away in dust bags.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Your favorite ___ for $___: Henleys	labels:I bought this henley that I've loved so much that I hung on to it long after it was dead.   It's a shades of grey brand henley.   What made it different was the way it was made. It was knitted and with fine details in the collar and buttons. The sleeves had a shape instead of just being tubes and so did the torso.

text:20 Sweaters for Less Than $150, So You Can Achieve Peak Coziness - Esquire.com	labels:So I shopped for knits from Uniqlo to BR, Jcrews. Then I upgraded to Harley of Scotland/Howlin -> handknitted Inverallan/Northern Watter.  Every single upgrade I see an increase in material quality, craftsmanship, and design.  I absolutely think your baseline should be around 70ish (used from ebay). Harley, Jamieson, and some brands about that price point are what you want to have. The Japanese made some good one too if you can get it proxy. Beams+ have some good ones and sales randomly, you have to keep checking though. Inis Meain is rare to come across at a low price. I bought one luckily from an eBay auction and it was 150 already for a cardigan.  If you are really into it, Inverallan, Northern Watters are what you wanna seek after.
text:You can still get excellent quality under 50 from ebay second hand. I got a 100% cashmere v neck from Pringle of Scotland for $40 last year and it has absolutely 0 flaws. Insane deal	labels:Nice. The brands I mentioned are that I own and bought. Havent tried others yet unless I sell some. It is great that you can find good ones at 40.  I just looked into the brand. Look like a lot of them are vintages and often fly under the radar. Great find!	episode_done:True
text:Can we talk sleepwear?	labels:I was very into this idea as well and invested in some Lunya PJs...but that elegant person I invisioned didn't magically appear. I still had a big messy bun, acne patches on my face and slept with my mouth wiiide open. I didn't feel as comfortable in those PJs and that fantasy I had didn't come true, ya know? I don't want to discourage you, just my two cents as someone who had a very similar thought process  I went back to tank tops and sweatpants and I find I appreciate them a lot more now. I make sure they fit properly and don't have stains or holes so I still feel reasonably put together.
text:THIS. I have been working on a lot of \~self improvement\~ this year and part of making my goals for 2021 has been distinguishing "the person I aspire to be" from "the person I am willing to be" from "the person I can afford to be."   I too have been on a journey to live a budget life of luxury especially when it comes to things like matching lingerie all the time and sleepwear and what I've realized is that I'm not actually interested in luxurious sleepwear. I'm actually interested in being the person that has two hours to unwind every night, takes a warm bath in a massive tub with a v expensive lush bath bomb, does a full face care routine, brushes her hair out, has little tinctures on her vanity to apply just a bit of perfume, puts on a silk gown, lights a candle, reads in bed, and turns out her lamp at a generous 9:30pm.   The truth is that the desire for the sleepwear is really a desire to have more silence, more time spent on me, and more time doing things that look and feel good simply because I like them and not because they serve any kind of real function.   I have moved away from using old t-shirts because I like the idea of dedicated sleepwear but I usually just go with a solid color cami / tank top / shirt and either some shorts or some sweat pants depending on how cold it is. They're cheaper but still look thoughtful.	labels:>part of making my goals for 2021 has been distinguishing "the person I aspire to be" from "the person I am willing to be" from "the person I can afford to be."   I need to frame this and put it on my wall.  Love your bedtime routine. Also want to mention that I have decided that decent black panties (like the 6-pack from H&M) match all the bras.

text:Is it just me, or does it seem like the clothes being sold since the pandemic began have become very limited?	labels:People are dying Kim
text:This is a fashion subreddit. What are we supposed to talk about here then?	labels:1. There have been a tonne of threads since March about how the pandemic affects supply chains due to almost a million people literally dying and crowded conditions in garment factories. To post an entire thread whining about not being able to find the perfect fit clothing for her specific preferences because garment workers aren't being put at extreme risk to produce clothing displays a genuinely shocking lack of empathy.  2. Its not actually that hard to find the kind of clothes OP is talking about on the websites she is talking about. I literally just went on the Express website and the fourth option for sweaters is a fitted crew neck with slim cut sleeves.  3.

text:Transition Lenses/Glasses	labels:Perhaps transition lenses have improved and it's a case of only noticing the bad ones, but I definitely see them tinted indoors occasionally and they look dopey. Like wearing sunglasses indoors in general.  I'd be uncomfortable buying them as a primary pair of glasses without trying out the transition for the day and seeing them actually transition quickly in my normal haunts.
text:They do transition quicker now with gen 8 version, but still not that quick  Takea about 3-4mins depending on where you live, colder climates are slower and tint gets darker, warmer is faster, but gets less tinted, in a car it doesn't work for those who drive that might be a big consideration  I was just thinking from style perspective and not looking like a nerd or ruining the look. The guy above is right, he said the same thing as my glass store if you get one you gotta go 1 size bigger, cuz they usually seem to make your glasses look smaller  But if you r indoor, your glasses look big, so you sacrifice on looks basically  I think they would look good if your frames are big and plastic made, I'm taking big big frames or if your pair is sold as sunglasses too, but I think having separate sunglasses is more practical, a hustle to carry, but does a better job if you got the space for it	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What was your "how in the name of all that is holy did this end up in a thrift store" find?	labels:It‚Äôs less about the value of the item and more about the stars aligning perfectly.  I wear a size 12-13W shoe, plus other things that make my feet really hard to fit, so I am used to buying formalwear to match the one maybe two pairs of formal shoes I own at any given time.  So when I was 17 and going to prom in 2006, my mom tried really hard to help me find shoes, any shoes, that were suitable. But we could only find casual flats or runners, and I realllly wanted to dress up nicely for the first real time in my life. So she said ‚Äúyou know what, let‚Äôs buy a dress and then we will just have to find a way.‚Äù  So I picked out a black and pale pink dress that just made me swoon, and I figured black heels would be easiest to find. Lol I was so young and stupid.  Anyway we searched high and low right up until the week of prom, we drove to the US from Canada and looked there and I still couldn‚Äôt find a pair of heels that fit enough to buy and I decided I‚Äôd just wear uncomfy like always and deal with it.   Then I randomly walked into a thrift store and saw on the shoe rack a pair of pink heels in the exact shade of pink on my dress, with black trim. Picked them up, size 12W. They fit like they were made for me.   Wore them until they broke three years ago.

So much fun fashion. What I wouldn't do for an entire day in Myeongdong just unloading all my cash. Something I've noticed is that a lot of trends that were popular over a decade ago have stuck around in some iteration -- pastels never seem to get old there, even if they're used in different ways. Oversized clothes were a staple then as now. Unabashed logos. I still try to incorporate facets of Korean fashion into how I dress over a decade later.	episode_done:True
text:What is your go-to favourite dress to wear in the cooler months?	labels:Definitely any kind of long-sleeved mini dress with fleece-lined tights underneath!   Right now I'm wearing a thick, black bodycon sweater dress (just... entirely in black, lol) and tomorrow for my birthday "party" I'm wearing a warm brown dress with white tights and brown booties underneath. My birthday can't get too depressing!

text:We‚Äôre in a post fashion world everything is in, looser fits have been very popular the last several years, you don‚Äôt have to wear them just to be on trend.  General advice is balancing out proportions, instead of wear one oversized item with a bunch of skinny stuff try to pair oversized tops to with looser pants and chunky footwear, I think layering helps to make the width look more intentional as well, and make sure things still fit you correctly(ie, don‚Äôt just buy things too large for you) you can expect stuff like slightly dropped shoulders or longer hemlines are oversized clothing but make sure it still falls relatively close to what you want, and have pants that are hemmed to not be pooling around your shoes, most people here prefer cropped cuts for looser pants but a half break or so is fine as well.	labels:that‚Äôs really helpful thank you	episode_done:True

text:Do you: 1) keep all of your wardrobe equally diverse, or 2) keep all of your wardrobe minimal, or 3) keep some pieces relatively similar while diversifying others?	labels:I have a maximalist capsule wardrobe where everything matches by way of a specific color palette.  EDIT: I have ten identical pairs of black sweats that I‚Äôve been living in. Never going back to leggings or jeans on bottom.	episode_done:True
text:How do comfort vs. style compare in what bottoms you wear?	labels:I mostly wear jeans/pants and I find them to be very comfortable personally. I'm honestly always a little surprised that they're so uncomfortable for most people. Most of my discomfort in skirts/dresses is mental (I just don't feel like me when I wear them).   I think if you enjoy wearing skirts you should keep wearing them, nothing wrong with that. If it's a seasonal thing maybe fleece stockings or something like that will allow you to wear them in the cooler months.
text:I feel the same, I love the comfort of trousers over skirts! Although skirts can look amazing, I can never relax while wearing them. They wrinkle, they bunch up, they slip or do all kinds of things when I want to tuck my legs under me or hang on the couch. I love a skirt to feel instantly dressed up, but immediately change into trousers when i get home	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What do you guys think about sites like Poshmark and Curtsey?	labels:I buy 90% of my clothes from Poshmark and ThredUp.    Poshmark: has a much larger inventory than ThredUp.  You can communicate with sellers and can often bundle items for discounts and ask for more pictures/measurements.  ThredUp: easier to search for a type of item (e.g. white cotton t-shirt) and save that search, which I find really helpful.  Much easier to find a specific fabric.  For example I love linen and there's no way to find linen clothes on Poshmark besides just searching "linen" and hoping the seller looked at the fabric.  Each item is shown on a mannequin, which is nice but sometimes it's difficult to see the details (hem, pattern, etc.).	episode_done:True
text:How do you tell when discounted items were never full price?	labels:It doesn't matter if they were sold at a higher price, plenty of crap is marked up regardless of quality. What matters is if they are a price you're willing to pay.  Also try checking other websites good the same item to see price variances.
text:I think it might matter a lot. Especially when buying online. The people setting the price knew what the item was worth approximately. If the item is crap you can only inflate the price so much. Even when you get into the whole brand markup.  There is a massive difference in quality for example in Nordstrom rack items that were made for the rack with a fake mark down vs the flagship store sale items. You can feel the difference in person but online how can you tell except a real mark-down?  I‚Äôm super interested in this topic OP. This is a good one.	labels:I think this is spot on, that there will be a difference in quality depending if it was made for outlets or boutiques. For stuff like leather goods (shoes and bags) and coats, there's a stark difference even if they're the same designer (ex: coach outlet vs coach, kate spade). I've been facing this same problem when trying to buy a purse myself and it's tough.	episode_done:True

text:A discussion about ‚Äúknockoff culture‚Äù	labels:I would't consider Sezane a paragon of originality at all. They are also copying someone.  Every season there is a grab bag of trends for people to interpret. This year we have big sleeves, chunky knits, and 70s office wear as the inspirations.   And each brand takes their spin, and washes it with their point of view. Sezane does its rendtiion in the classic, same for brands like J.Crew and Banana Republic. Madewell's version is a little hipster and boho takes on the same classics. Anthropogie is quirky femme takes on the trends. Gap would do the plainest version - yes to chunky knits but not super statement sleeves.  It is hard to deem a solid knit sweater as a knockoff, there are only so many versions you can make.
text:Yeah Sezane didn't invent bodysuits and pom sweaters, they're all copying from somewhere else and EVERYONE is making these. I think it's bullshit that it's only ever cheap brands that get called out.  When Sezane sells rip-offs, it's "inspired" or "trendy" (but in a ~timeless~ rich person way ofc), when a cheaper store does it, it's a "blatant rip-off" and "stolen intellectual property"? Girl, please.	labels:Exactly.  I‚Äôve seen both things a million times before.  But it‚Äôs overpriced so I guess it‚Äôs theirs?	episode_done:True
text:How do you find your true style when you're surrounded by fast fashion?	labels:I feel this! I‚Äôve been frustrated with browsing slow fashion/ethical niche brands lately, because while not fast fashion, they seem incredibly expensive and visually underwhelming for the most part. Shapeless and baggy just doesn‚Äôt look effortless on my body, and I‚Äôm far too grown to be going about half naked.   My solution has been looking to eras before fast fashion for inspiration, and learning about historical/couture techniques to sew myself the pieces I‚Äôm envisioning if I can‚Äôt thrift them (you could always get a tailor to make you something to fit too). Sketching has helped me a lot to think through shapes, colors, and how they look on my frame. It could change your perspective, instead of seeing clothes on other people and imagining yourself in them, start with a picture of yourself and imagine clothes that would make you comfortable and confident.	episode_done:True

text:How to build an age-suitable varied chic wardrobe?	labels:>French chic and preppy school girl  Have you ever heard of the brand Claudie Pierot? It's suitable for your age, but it's really perfect for this. It's probably too pricey, but maybe you can copy that style elsewere. Also, I am East Asian - women tend to look very young and our fashion is geared a lot towards looking youthful as well. Maybe you can get some inspiration with how we style stuff too.  Anyways, I remember how hard it was as a teen to hear "dress however you want and don't worry about it" from people and have it mean anything (hell, that's the case for me even now in my mid-thirties). So I'll just say this - people will definitely notice if you dress differently than them, but they are less likely to think you're trying "too hard" if you don't act differently (better or different than them, seeking validation, etc. etc.) because of how you dress or if you avoid drawing attention to your clothes specifically (like name dropping brands or styles or being not willing to go certain places or do certain things because you're not dressed appropriately).	episode_done:True

text:Changing Your Habits: Deciding to Not Shop Brands for Ethical or Other Reasons & Following Through	labels:One thing I do is remind myself that whatever I want isn't usually one of a kind. This helps me with makeup buying, because I fall in love with colours and buy them and my lipstick collection is out of control. I have to keep reminding myself that whatever beautiful colour I just found out about is either a dupe of something I probably have OR if that colour isn't something I own but the brand is garbage, that other brands will definitely have that colour too.  So for fashion, if you fall in love with a bag from a brand you can't support, just remember that no bag is unique (unless it's like an awesome bag that looks like a giraffe or something). If you love Chanel flaps but refuse to buy from them, there are so many other versions. I have one by Rebecca Minkoff but luxury brands make chain flap purses too without the ickiness of supporting Coco Chanel.  I'm a knitter and weaver, so most knit and woven things I can make myself if I don't like the brand. Same with yarn, if there's a yarn company I don't support, there are millions of other yarn brands out there where I can find something similar enough.  In general, no matter what you're trying to buy, there will be other brands that make something like it. So if you must have it, you don't have to buy from the brand you hate.	episode_done:True

text:Advice needed: How to keep up with trends without social media?	labels:Your best bet is going old school and following blogs. Set up an RSS feed, find people you like, and follow fashion that way.   But this is also a good time for you to explore YOUR personal style, without the influence of... uh... influencers. Obviously some of the fun of fashion is finding out what the trends are as dictated by other people, but with a little freedom from those, you might create silhouettes and combinations that are far more interesting to you personally than whatever's popping off on IG this week.  You can also do what I do and set up an IG that's just for this kind of thing. I don't follow anyone I know, I don't post anything on there. It's just for me to keep up with fashion, some bands I like, and a few owls managed to sneak their way in there. If you set up something like that, you can set aside an hour on the weekend and get caught up on fashion stuff without even installing the app on your phone. A lot of influencers are on YouTube too, so if you'd prefer to stay away from IG altogether, you can just look for their YouTube pages and watch their content on the weekend.

text:If money were no object? Bespoke or haute couture?	labels:I think /u/Ghoticptox pretty much summed it up perfectly, nothing to really add. I personally have no interest in bespoke because I value design more than minuscule fit details, I think this sub has a tendency to overemphasize how important fit actually is, especially considering how nebulous of a concept ‚Äúgood fit‚Äù even is.  Like, the fit ‚Äúissues‚Äù you highlighted,   >shoulder tiny bit broad in one coat, a little extra material in the waist of another.  Are complete non issues to me, that‚Äôs just variance in fit and design, I wouldn‚Äôt blink at that on a piece I otherwise really love.  The more important thing to me, and I can‚Äôt believe no one else has mentioned this yet, your friend got into clothing a couple months ago, he doesn‚Äôt even know what he likes, it sounds like, and I mean this judgement free, he‚Äôs just going around looking for the most expensive thing he can find, I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôd recommend anyone go and buy a $4000 coat right as they‚Äôre getting into fashion. Like, is he rich enough that he can afford to make that work or rich enough that it literally doesn‚Äôt matter? Because I think unless $4000 is something you can spend in a day and not blink itms probably not a good idea to go and drop $4000 and a true bespoke coat when he could end up getting into streetwear in 3 months and never wear it again. At least in that case something like YSL will retain value better and can be sold for more, as opposed to a lot of traditional tailoring brands, which go for pennies on the dollar on the used market	episode_done:True

text:Brooks Brothers's Future Looks a Lot Like Menswear‚Äôs Past	labels:* Less SKUs. The amount of stuff BB sells is overwhelming.  * Do away with there weirdly named fit system. Change it to Extra Slim, Slim, Regular, Thicc Daddies * Revamp the BB website. It's been terrible for a long time. * Have the athleisure stuff, but also focus on high quality basics, again with less SKUs. Have something like an "essentials" line. The Navy Suit. The Charcoal Suit. The OCDB. The Chino. The Wool Trouser. Without fifty million variations thereof. You go now and it's like here are three navy suits with different kinds of stretch, here are four more with some kind of temperature controlling fabric. Just give me a half to full canvas lined 100% wool navy suit in various fits and sizes. In other words, simplify your menswear line to cut down on SKUs, and that will give you more room to play with sheep on skis and stuff (i think that does sound kind of cute, very Ralph Lauren). * Do away with Golden Fleece, Red Fleece. Mainline only. Again confusing to the consumer. * Where BB could play more is in areas like sport shirts. By all means offer your classics like blackwatch etc., but other menswear shops like Sid Mashburn or Todd Snyder offer all kinds of fun prints and colors while still feeling like classic #menswear.  i dunno, just riffing my own personal desires for BB. i don't know anything about running a large clothing manufacturer and retailer.
text:I worked for brooks brothers retail a couple years during college summer and spring breaks. Honestly, I pretty much agreed. I imagine they should keep golden fleece a la RL purple label but there was a lot of confusion in naming of things that I had to re-expain to practically *every single customer*	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What are your coziest winter finds/essentials?	labels:Definitely fleece-lined leggings/tights. I have a few in fun colours but also nude ones to wear under sheer tights to get that look but stay warm.  Waterproof lined, heeled boots (Ecco is great) are also a staple for me. If you can't tell, I like my skirts/dresses year-round so these two things keep me warm.	episode_done:True

text:Brands that no longer live up to their name or quality	labels:This comes up here a lot, but many of the outdoors brands have turned into mostly fashion brands, and the quality has dropped as a result. The North Face, with the exception of a few of their collections (e.g. Summit); Columbia, and Mountain Hardware which they bought; and Marmot are some of the more famous examples.  Patagonia, Arc'teryx, Outdoor Reaearch, Fjallraven, and Kuhl are currently good alternatives, but I like to check the ultralight / camping subreddits for the most up to date info.	episode_done:True
text:What is your go to/favourite belt?	labels:I like the basic leather ones from Lucky Brand. In the sense that they‚Äôre actually pretty good quality leather. Not the ‚Äúleather‚Äù (listed as leather on the product page) but they‚Äôre easy to crack and won‚Äôt last.  I have a basic black leather belt, basic brown leather belt, and a leather woven belt. I use them all pretty often. Maybe the woven a little more than the others.	episode_done:True

Different athletic gear as I've started running since I cant play volleyball for fitness.

text:agree that the sidebar would be worth looking at, but just know it might not be perfectly catered to someone in their late teens.

text:Buying vs selling on resell websites	labels:I buy/sell on eBay, Poshmark, depop, and Mercari. There are pros and cons to all of them. For me I‚Äôm not trying to make money or save money necessarily‚ÄîI just want to recycle clothes that didn‚Äôt work for me and from everything I‚Äôve read most donated clothes end up in landfills. I also prefer to buy secondhand for similar reasons.   Poshmark definitely has the best customer service. I‚Äôve dealt with a lot of bad sellers (listing the wrong size, clothes not as described etc) and whenever I‚Äôve reached out to Poshmark they basically refund all my money and let me keep the item. On the flip side, as a seller people have unnecessarily complained (item didn‚Äôt fit) and Poshmark didn‚Äôt allow them to send the item back for a refund‚Äîmaybe Poshmark gave them a refund and let them keep the item but I wasn‚Äôt effected. This is something that REALLY irritates me about eBay‚Äîthey always take the side of the buyer and u end up having wasted time, money etc shipping something even when u aren‚Äôt at fault. I really wish eBay would absorb the costs like Poshmark does, but this is probably why Poshmark has the highest fees.  Ultimately I think the downfall of Poshmark will be the wholesalers and people who are doing it as a side hustle. It‚Äôs becoming harder and harder for sellers with 20-30 listings from their actual personal closet to sell things because there‚Äôs so much garbage for buyers to sift through. It‚Äôs also hard for me as a buyer to find bundles anymore. In the early days sellers closets were made up of actual clothes from their closets so they were all the same size and the style of the person selling. Now if I find something I like it‚Äôs impossible to find another item in someone‚Äôs closet because there are 500 random listings to sift through.
text:Exactly my problem with it.  I get so excited now when I find a closet that's just a few items all clearly the same size.  Those sellers are usually more reasonable on price too because the items would just get donated.  The people selling full time as a job on there have kinda ruined it for me.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What do you guys think about sites like Poshmark and Curtsey?	labels:I get a lot of stuff on ebay because I find it less expensive than Poshmark.	episode_done:True
text:Hair accessories - professional or should be saved for casual environments?	labels:I think they‚Äôre like jewelry accessories. They range from wild to professional. If you style a very plain item in a wild way, it‚Äôs no longer a plain item. Like hair colored bobby pins used to sculpt your hair into a helicopter. I think scrunchies can be great with a sleek bun or a lovely scarf as a head wrap and still look professional. A headband with horns may not fit in all offices, but maybe that‚Äôs a vibe of an office that works.	episode_done:True

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - January 17, 2021	labels:Heya, I am updating my wardrobe to be a little more ‚Äúclean‚Äù and  ‚Äúmodern‚Äù as I get a little older. Previously I have almost entirely shopped vintage/thrifted my wardrobe but it‚Äôs just gotten bloated and unfocused. That being said I don‚Äôt know a lot about clothing brands. Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôm looking for:  -Ideally US made, or at the very least ethically produced. I want to avoid exploitive fast-fashion. This was a big reason I previously only thrifted.   -Decent quality, I don‚Äôt have the money to buy super high-end but I am fine with paying a little more for something that will last.   -specifically looking for some solid color cardigans and button-ups, a sweater or hoodie or two, black chinos and black jeans, and some decent priced white tees. I found that I almost always wear black pants + white shirt + black/navy/olive/beige top. I‚Äôm pretty happy with that formula right now, just looking on ways to riff on it endlessly.   -Previously I have liked Everlane and Los Angeles Apparel, if that‚Äôs any kind of frame of reference.  Thanks for any help!
text:A quick note that MiUSA(or any other first world country) does not mean ethical, there‚Äôs a very recent post about Canada Goose‚Äôs labor practices as well as a comment a couple days back in or GD thread of someone accidentally running into a sweatshop in NYC, and, ironically, the two brands you posted, Everlane and LAA, are good examples as well, Everlane is famous at this point for greenwashing and union busting and LAA has hd several complaints about their labour practices, as well as the owner...not being a good person	labels:You probably know this, but just for the sake of the thread - LA Apparel's owner literally got hundreds of employees infected and several killed by Covid by ignoring well established practices regarding worker safety.

Can confirm that the neck lanyard is extremely handy, as you can take off the mask while it still hangs around your neck. The adjustable ear loops are also super handy and comfortable.

I tend toward solid color clothing, and then add interest with texture or hardware over pattern. The only thing I have in my closet that have any type of pattern are shoes, because I make custom sneakers for myself.   If you like leopard then rock it. I think there are a lot less stereotypes embedded with clothing these days, but maybe that‚Äôs just the area I live in right now. Especially with the popularity of 90‚Äôs trends and thrifting, I think people just like to see creative mixing and new combinations.	episode_done:True
text:Noel Fielding X Fendi menswear colab	labels:I think Noel Fielding's art work is fun, and he is a very fun, odd dude. I loved him in IT Crowd, and he's weird as ever in the B. Baking series.   His Fendi graphics are arguably the better items in the fashion show, but wouldn't it be just as good if they used another contemporary artist? I feel that this type of graphics can be interchangeable. Any local graffiti artist could do something interesting. Noel is just famous.
text:> Noel is just famous.  I think part of the reason for this kind of collab is that the collaborator brings their followers to the audience for the clothing company‚Äôs work.  There are a lot of choices for customers out there nowadays, and to sell high end things you first have to get people to look at them.  Fielding‚Äòs signature look is playful and casual, but still meticulous and of high quality.  For the well-paid WFH crowd, who are no longer spending their clothing budget on daily office wear, I think this collab is a good marketing strategy.  Plus, I like the bold colors, and the cozy tactile stuff - high fashion but comfy - is really perfect right now.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:WEEKLY DEALZ	labels:I am still reeling from the Nordstrom rack sales on Everlane items. They are so good. The sneakers are really good quality for 19 bucks, and I do see sizes come back, if you check daily. I bought a pair for myself and a pair for my friend.  I also bought a few clothing items that is taking forever to ship though. I might cancel some of them and wait out the rest. I mean, 30ish bucks for dresses/jumpsuits and 40s for cashmere is a pretty good deal, and it's not like Everlane's style is gonna change much. They sell the same shit year in and year out.

text:How does a warm weather wardrobe differ from a cold weather wardrobe?	labels:I moved from the Midwest to Atlanta. If it‚Äôs a similar climate dont get rid of all your winter clothes! I got rid of so much thinking it would be warm year round but it still gets really cold about 3 months out of the year. I kept one good winter coat as well. Also because you get used to the warm weather high fifties/sixties can feel wayyyy colder than it should
text:it's New Orleans! i'm moving from Maine	labels:That is so exciting! New Orleans could not be more different than Maine, but I hope you love it. I move from Oregon to Texas, and it was a huge adjustment, but now I really like it here.  Like the other commenter said, keep a coat and a few sweaters. When it‚Äôs ‚Äúcold‚Äù here, it actually feels colder to me than when I lived in the North. The summer is pretty brutally hot, so I only wear natural fibers now (polyester makes me very sweaty), and lots of short and dresses. No jeans in the summer at all. You do need something to put on when you go inside because of the A/C, but don‚Äôt be like me and think you can still wear sweaters in the summer in the South like I did in Oregon.  Have so much fun! Moving to New Orleans is worth it for the food alone.  Edit: This is not weather-related, but the biggest difference to me between northern and southern dressing is that in the South, women generally look way more polished than in the North. I‚Äôve been in Texas long enough now that when I go to Oregon, I‚Äôm always thinking ‚ÄúWhy doesn‚Äôt anyone take care of themselves up here?‚Äù Haha just something to keep in mind...	episode_done:True

text:I'm having the exact same reaction. And I wasn't a huge fan of this style the first time around. But OP I do like several of the work outfits and I think you did a good job at incorporating the Y2K aesthetic into work appropriate pieces.  This style of fashion was a serious reaction to grunge and reflected the more optimistic and hopeful feeling around the early 2000s. I was in high school for grunge and in grad school and working in the 2000s and the kids 5-10 years younger than me absolutely loved this style but I 100% hated it, and I was definitely not optimistic (and unfortunately was correct about a lot of my guesses about the future). It's a look that reflects a very specific moment in time.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - January 07, 2021	labels:I'm in a ambivalent state of mind right now. For a like over a year now I have been into streetwear. Baggy, oversized clothes with lots of prints and branding. This was my first period of taking clothing serious and feeling "fashionable". But one can only see so many of the "same" outfits.  I grew really tired of streetwear in the last couple of weeks but I'm scared to leave my comfort zone. I'm 20 years old but feel like dressing like a teenager. I really really like graphic tees if the prints are well done and If I would imagine dressing like lets say Tim Dessaint for example, who is not into graphics/"crazyness" at all, It would feel too "mature" for my age if that makes sense.  But at the very same time, I feel like im dressing too childish when wearing cargo pants + graphic tee.  Am I overthinking this?
text:Do you feel like your current clothing no longer represents how you want to be seen, or do you just feel a bit uninspired right now? The former is what pushes people to change styles; my current wardrobe has almost no traces of my previous interest in streetwear. The latter might mean you're feeling a bit stuck but still want to keep doing streetwear, in which case I would recommend looking at brands such as OAMC, Noah NY, Cav Empt, Fear of God, Awake NY, or Brain Dead, all of which are "streetwear" but are doing really cool things to present a distinct vision.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Sizing relationships between brands	labels:Some websites (department stores, ASOS) have a true fit tool where you put in your measurements, body type, and well fitting item of clothing and that information is used to recommend sizing.   It‚Äôs also a good idea to know your measurements in general if you‚Äôre buying secondhand as many sellers will list the measurements of the garment.  But overall sizing can be so wild within one brand, much less across multiple that I dint think there‚Äôs much of a rule of thumb.
text:I second this! I made a note in my phone with all of my measurements and it's saved me a lot of time and money. Before I buy anything I compare my measurements with the websites size guide (I do it for each individual item) and select whatever size *they* have listed for my measurements.   These are measurements I keep personally:  Height Bust Band Waits Hips Hollow to Hemlines  Hollow to floor  Inseam:   For some of these (mainly bottoms) I jotted down my true measurements using a tape measurer and also took measurements of jeans that I already had that fit well.	labels:I did that too, but I don't have all of these.

Also what's defined as short? If someone is 5'7" do they get to wear long coats? What if they're 5'7.5"??  It also throws the idea out the window of the whole horizontal breaks thing that people complain about for cropped trousers or high-waisted pants. Suddenly you have a wonderful garment type that can give you long, **tall**, and elegant lines and it's impossible to wear.   People complain all the damn time about menswear being too "restrictive" and women's wear being more "exciting" but everyone is too much of a wimp to wear a ~ L O N G C O A T ~.  I fucking hate fashion "rules" and "guidelines" and literally everything having to do with the word "flattering". If you care so much about these gender norms, masculinity and being ~ flattering ~ then sack up and wear the clothes you like.   That whole thread is just people saying that someone else told them they couldn't *wear a coat* so what should they do? Oh idk. How about tell them to fuck off and wear the damn coat.  </rant>
text:People are so odd. If you‚Äôre 4 foot 12 you‚Äôre gonna look that way whether you have a long ass coat or a short ass coat.    Seconded your line about fashion ‚Äúrules‚Äù.

I am looking to find a distributor for Comfort Colors in Canada but unfortunately the only spot I can seem to find individual shirts for purchase is Amazon.ca.

text:Top of WAYWT - November 2020	labels:I don‚Äôt understand the whole thing with pants that are way too short.
text:Pants ending before they hit the shoes =/= too short  Cropped pants are used for a variety of reasons - to visually shorten the legs, to alter the overall silhouette of the outfit, to place more emphasis on the shoes, to increase air flow on the ankles/legs, etc.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Accessories newbie and am not sure where to start...what are your must-have starter pieces?	labels:Accessories are just as subject to cycles in fashion as anything else, but I always save mine even when I throw out tops and pants. Partly that is because my body won‚Äôt outgrow a necklace.   For some reason every woman around me was wearing stars the last two years, and I never saw it outside of this town. But because I had kept some old star earrings I had stopped wearing, I was already set to be on-trend. I think super thin necklaces are on the way out. But if you already have one you really like and don‚Äôt mind putting it away for several years, chances are it will be fashionable again.  And since you‚Äôre going for adult fashion, don‚Äôt forget black leather (or glittery plastic) business card cases. Even if your field doesn‚Äôt use business cards, you can put credit cards in them. I like the Francesca‚Äôs chain for those.	episode_done:True

text:What do you think are the pieces of jewelry everyone should own?	labels:I don‚Äôt know about ‚Äúeveryone should own,‚Äù but I have a pair of square opal studs that I wear allll the time. The white goes with everything, the colored specks add interest, the shape is unique, and they don‚Äôt look as fancy as pearls. I can wear them grocery shopping or to an event. I love opals so much!

text:"freeing the titty" when you don't have "fashion boobs"?	labels:This post feels like it's coming from my brain! Yesterday I wore a bralette for the first time along with a low cut top and, while I was comfortable, I was also really self conscious. I ended up changing to a top with a higher neckline for a zoom hang with friends. I'm not used to my boobs being in a natural, saggy position on my body.  I have a figure that's somewhere between hourglass and pear shaped so I have always tried to dress in a way that makes my bust larger and higher in order to balance out my hips. Seeing the other posts on this thread gives me hope that it's just the need to re-train my eye.	episode_done:True

text:FAQ: How do I know my clothes weren't made with slave labour?	labels:Same as always, buy used, you can‚Äôt trust corporations to tell you the truth about their labour practices, in part because they have a very vested interest in not telling you the truth and in part because actually tracking he supply chains for clothing is incredibly difficult to do accurately, and, yes this applies to the cool mid range denim brand that replies to all your posts on ig. Even Patagonia got busted for using Slave Labor, if you look past the long winded apology letters they put out since they got caught, the reality is that it‚Äôs basically intrinsically locked into the supply chain of modern clothing production unless you're paying thousands upon thousands of dollars to have a local tailor make all of your clothes using locally sourced materials.  Buying used is the single most ethical option you have, and, frankly, is the better option anyway	episode_done:True
text:What are you hate wearing?	labels:Just a mix of nonstop leggings and sweatpants. I miss dressing up but I'm so fucking lazy. On a good day, I shower and change into leggings, a bralette, a  teeshirt and sweater/sweatshirt. On a bad day I just stay in my pajamas all day.
text:I feel this at my core. I used to wear such casual chic clothing around my clients with big funky accessories and always with a bold lip color. But now, I am in hatelove with a gigantic chunky green sweater from Target that cost me all of $22, but I wash and dry it as if it were some high end boutique item from a Brooklyn designer. Gentle cycle, cold water. Fluff. Hang dry. And then I wear it again for 3 days in a row without makeup because I can't even begin to relate to my stylish clothes. They seem like old friends I've lost touch with and I forget what we have in common.	labels:	episode_done:True

Durable, in colours and materials I want, cheaper, and shouldn‚Äôt need replacing till the end of highschool (I started this year.). Added bonus is that I‚Äôve never had a single store bought item fit before I altered it (I‚Äôve altered everything I own at this point.) while stuff I sew fits first try.

text:I wouldn't say they are ugly, but they aren't my favorite, either.  I've found the 998 straddles the line perfectly between looks, uniqueness, and funkiness.	labels:oooh some of the Made in UK 998s have definitely caught my eye before... haha I might be tempted if I keep looking at them
text:When I bought my 998s, I had probably ordered 4 or 5 different other models to try to find the perfect balance.  I've owned 574s for years (and still have a pair I wear regularly), but wanted something a bit more unique.  Bottom line, I'm not cool enough to pull off the more "dadlike" New Balances, which it seems modern style is trending towards.  The 998s were as close as I can get.  For the dadlike ones, you've got to have your entire fit absolutely on point.  If anything else is slacking, the shoes look unintentionally bad and not good at all.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:People who've been working from home for most of 2020 - do you think your work style will change when you go back to the office (compared to your work wardrobe pre-lockdown)? If so, how?	labels:I am a teacher that went back to working in the building at the beginning of September, so to be fair I was only wfh for several months in the spring, but it still drastically changed my style, or my perspective on my style.   Pre-Covid my work style (and general style) had morphed over the years to become very, very minimal and neutral. Lots of Everlane and Eileen Fisher. This was both because I wanted to be taken seriously at my job (I read very young) and because it also seemed like what was in style to me.   Returning to work in the fall, I realized I really f*cking hated all of my sensible, plain, go with everything black and grey clothes.   I still really prefer earth tones and blacks and greys, and I still wear some pretty simple outfits somedays, but I went on a small spree on The RealReal after I had my realization. I bought myself some louder statement pieces that feel more me, including an embroidered Happy Sheep sweater, a knit Missoni sheath dress, a multi-colored leather and fur purse, platform oxfords, and a couple of geometric patterned silk shirts and dresses.   For me life is too short to try so hard to be timeless and professional. I‚Äôm not knocking the look, it just isn‚Äôt ~me~ I want to love the clothes I wear and the clothes I love are fun knits and patterns.

text:Do you feel the black Friday sales better or worse than usually this year? Is it worth to buy clothing you won't wear until next year?	labels:Maybe this is just the stores I'm looking at, but it seems like the new stuff that I'm actually interested in isn't on sale this Black Friday, but everything else that's not as good is 40% off. It's annoying, because splashing a big number like that ("30-50% off the whole site! \*exclusions apply") draws me to their site, but the items I actually want aren't a part of the sale.  The only exception being Levi's because I've been waiting for this 40% off sale to get a pair of Wedgie jeans.   Not going to lie, I did buy quite a few bits from the sales this year but with the intention of returning 90% of it because I don't feel comfortable going into stores to try stuff on. Best to buy everything I want to try on at sale prices then return what I don't want to keep!
text:This has always been something I hated! I also think that Black Friday sales are overblown and actually not that good (for clothes). I typically wait until January to shop for sales because that's when retailers are trying to dump inventory to make their year end numbers look better. (Fiscal year for retailers ends in January and doesn't follow the calendar year.)	labels:Oh that's a good idea! I can reliably count on shops like Madewell, Levi's, Abercrombie & Fitch, etc. to have sales at the end of the season. The only problem is whether or not they'll have my size when the sale happens or if they're sold out of everything except XS and XL...	episode_done:True

I miss being able to wear statement earrings without them getting caught in my mask loops. I miss wearing bronzer and blush. I miss being able to do my hair (I mostly keep it up when I go out, to avoid it getting tangled with my mask loops). I MISS SHOPPING WITH FRIENDS.   Ugh.

text:Dressing larger bodies - without looking sloppy	labels:>and like Grandma's ashamed of her weight gain on fat people.  People wear what they like.

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - November 23, 2020	labels:I'd like to expand my knowledge about 90s fashion, brands, and styles. Particularly the way Jerry Seinfeld dressed on his show.   I would like to be pointed in the right direction on:  1. Brands of this style (jackets, shirts, bottoms, etc.) 2. Fit for men of this style 3. any other resources!  &#x200B;  Thanks!
text:I was just watching a bunch of Seinfeld episodes with my kids and took some mental notes on Jerry‚Äôs style. He kind of has a uniform consisting of a baggy OCBD (often in unusual bold or pastel colors) tucked into slim-fitting jeans. The current oversized trend doesn‚Äôt really replicate what Jerry is doing with his shirt fits, as his button-down is generally too big all around ‚Äî his shoulder seams often extend well past his natural shoulder and his pit-to-pit is a full 4 inches or larger than his natural chest. Check out the J. Crew 1994 line, which uses patterns from around that time period and can capture that billowy silhouette. The jeans are probably just Levi‚Äôs.  For outerwear, LL Bean and Eddie Bauer capture the vaguely outdoorsy casual vibes he usually gives off, things like barn coats and parkas. You never see him in a sleek wool topcoat.  When Jerry is performing, he‚Äôs usually in a loose-fitting sportcoat with big shoulder pads ‚Äî your best bet there would be to look at vintage Gucci from the 90s on the secondhand sites.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:why are men's clothing generally not as expensive and better quality?	labels:This makes me think of a conversation I had with my husband yesterday - he asked me (on my next run to the thrift store) to pick him up some track pants as his main pair have gotten a hole and it's too cold to run in shorts.  I told him he didn't want to wear thrift store track pants (I have spent many hours digging through the men's and women's sections in our local thrift stores for both of us).    Husband: why not?  Me: Let me put it this way.  Women tend to donate their clothes when they don't *want* them anymore. Men tend donate when they *can't* use them anymore.     Men's clothes don't change as much, and men tend to either wear them until they're ruined or they cannot use them (aka, they gain/lose weight, change jobs, have a spouse donate them, they move and can't store it etc).  So while you can still find good stuff if you really dig, there's way more staining, missing buttons, fading and wear on men's thrift clothes.      My usual score for husband at thrift stores is  (formerly) expensive cashmere and wool sweaters, and occasionally, high quality dress pants and shorts.  Nice jeans and regular shirts are hard to find, and this is probably related to the fact that others have pointed out - men can wear their clothes for 10+ years and still be moderately in style.    As for men's clothes that I wear - I never buy women's socks for work.  Always men's wool and cushioned socks.  Same with any kind of technical under layers for martial arts.  I like the women's designs better, but for some reason they assume the women have no boobs and I'll have 2-3 inches of stomach showing under a rash guard.  So I buy men's.	episode_done:True

text:[Serious answers only] FAQ: Why does runway fashion looks like nothing you'd ordinarily wear on the daily?	labels:The clothes on the runway are designed to represent, as closely as possible, the idea and sentiment that the designer is using to inspire the new line.  It's analogous to the Platonic ideal. Because the ideas can be so abstract, so too must the clothes. In fact, you can think of it as a series of progressive dilutions, from the designer's mind, to the runway, and then to the clothes that you wear in your day-to-day.

text:Does anyone have any visual guides for how clothes should fit	labels:I think part of fitting issues are not necessarily visually seen, but can be felt, or worst only show up when you wear an item.  First thing try to look at how a garment fits as if it were just lines and curves and if there is anything there you would neaten or straighten or erase in photoshop. This can be things like something fitting uneven (might be too loose on top, or a skirt might be too tight and pull up at the back on the waistband), or button lines not laying flat , doing this () rather than this ||, or wrinkles under the armpits (too tight), or cameltoe.  Then there is wear, something might look right on the mirror, but turn out to be too tight or too loose or too short or too long when you wear it and walk around. Skirts and dresses slipping up, or you stepping on their hem when walking up stairs. A mistake I do despite that I  should know better but do not, I buy too big in he shoulders tshirts or blouses and then their neckline slips around during the day making it look a bit askew or showing bra straps.  Then there is aesthetics, what is one person's right fit might be another's too tight or too loose. I have mentioned I do not like when the buttons of tops do this () but some people do not mind. I once mentioned that I think a leather jacket or trend, even if meant to be worn open always has to be able to close properly or it looks visually too small, like the flaps even open look wrong - that comment got downvoted a bit  so clearly there are different opinions	episode_done:True

text:Brands that no longer live up to their name or quality	labels:kind of all of them? It seems like you have to pay pretty steep prices now to get the quality of clothes that mid-price mall brands had in the 1990s and early 2000s. It seems that most stores have switched to a model of selling poor quality pieces at huge markups with the expectation that they will sell most of the stock at clearance prices. The GAP used to have quality staples, and J Crew was "fancy." Now GAP is really the same quality as Old Navy, and don't know what J Crew is anymore. The quality has certainly dropped, but I also don't get what is up with the designs since you can't even get a reasonable women's suit there these days. Madewell is not made well. Anthropologie used to sell unique pieces with really good construction, now it's roughly the same as other fast fashion, though I do appreciate that they added petite and plus sizing and carry some high end brands too. Levi's main line is terrible now, and to get the heritage quality, you need to get the Made and Crafted line, which is really expensive!  I mostly shop secondhand because I can't afford the stuff I like. When buying new, I try to wait for sales and avoid buying anything "final sale" or with complicated returns unless I know it will work. Clothes that I used to get at Anthropologie, I now get from Sezane, Ulla Johnson, Doen, and Samantha Pleet. I started buying vintage jeans over Madewell/Levi's or expensive craft brands‚Äîmy 1980s Chic and Gitano jeans were probably sold at K-Mart/Target but are better quality than anything I have gotten from Madewell. I don't wear jeans/denim enough to justify craft denim prices. Patagonia is still very high quality technical wear; I just scope out the Tyler sport outlet and secondhand for deals. Shoes are hard because I don't like to get them secondhand. I switched from Adidas to Veja and Diemme for sneakers (you can find Diemme shoes for huge markdowns on Yoox during the winter and summer sales‚ÄîI don't think they are worth retail price).

text:why are men's clothing generally not as expensive and better quality?	labels:Women will pay more for their clothes, and pay more for nicer clothes than men will. Supply and demand, baby.
text:Supply and demand is a lie, it's like saying evolution has a plan. Sometimes things just turn to shit. If there is no one competing with great quality for fair prices, mediocre shit will rise to the top.  Companies might be 60% right on what the customer want. But they jack prices to compensate so they are still doing well. Like H&M burn a ton of clothes, but are still doing well, because they will profit if they sell 1 item for every 2 they burn.  Companies know the customer wants a dress with pockets in high quality, and it would sell well. BUT the profit margin would be much better on a shitty item with money spent on marketing rather then quality.  Small companies might make the perfect item, but they will be more expensive because of the small volumes, and more sensitive to a bad year. And can't afford marketing.  Women will buy shit if shit's the only thing offered. Men will wear their old stuff rather then buy shit.  Uniqlo is murdering the Nordic market because they came in and offered the product "women didn't want" to a wider base then 16-30. And now both men and women of all ages are crowding the store will the ones that "know what the modern woman want" are having sale after sale. They really didn't think women wanted a cheap blue wool sweater rather then a flimsy transparent blouse.	labels:It‚Äôs still supply and demand, they‚Äôre just creating artificial demand for their product.

text:How do you guys work towards avoiding fast fashion?	labels:I think it‚Äôs unavoidable, so yep like another commenter said, just choose wisely, and I would also add don‚Äôt ‚Äògive in‚Äô to any whims and infatuations. I put something in my online shopping cart (or even hold it and walk around the actual shop), and a few moments later I realise I don‚Äôt need it and close the tab/put it back.  For me the biggest thing is knowing my style. I know what things I look best (yes ‚Äòbest‚Äô, not just ‚Äògood‚Äô) in, so I have these items in my closet and I am not likely to randomly get more clothes whenever I feel like it. And knowing your style, you‚Äôll also know you‚Äôll wear the items you buy a lot, so you‚Äôll not feel bad about spending more money and ‚Äòinvesting‚Äô in pieces. :)	episode_done:True

text:MFA Brand MegaReview: Zara | January 30, 2021	labels:twice, I've coincidentally lived right next to a Zara (like a 2-3 minute walk). As a result I often popped into the store and bought a few things.  My experiences were hit and miss, mostly misses  Hits:    Faux suede stuff.  They look and feel nice. I've often get compliments on it. I don't like dealing with actual suede, so the faux stuff is nice.     Sizing. so far sizing for tops has mostly been consistent so its easy to order online and know what to expect  Returns. super easy either online or in person.  Sales. Here they go on sale immediately July 1 and Jan 1.  You can get good deals on many things such as a faux suede jacket for roughly 20 USD, a long coat for roughly 30, etc  Style.  I think thats the reason many go here.  The styling looks really unique and interesting. although yes, there are really strange stuff there too  Blazers/sport coats.  Fits well and looks nice.  Miss:  Stitching. Like some one said earlier, its really bad. things are always loose, buttons fall off, even buckles break. more than half of the Zara items I've bought had some major stitching issues within the first half year.   Jackets. although they are cool, I've had all kinds of problems. A bomber jacket where all texture threads became loose and made a hole.  A linen moto jacket where the buckle just broke off and fixing it costed more than the jacket. My Faux suede sherling denim style jacket looks great and new but all the button stitching around the button holes have all frayed.. and i hardly use the buttons since there are zippers!   Knits. unravels, pills quickly etc  all Bottoms. discolors easily. pills easily. tons of loose threading  when I was a college student it was nice. the sale items are cheap and you can look cool  but after graduating, having more disposable income, etc.. I've mostly moved on.	episode_done:True

text:Overdressing - Discussion	labels:Oh god. I'm instantly reminded of the embarrassment I felt whenever I showed up to a pregame for a frat formal and then realized it was SEMIFORMAL. I was there in a long red gown and everyone was in minidresses... I already felt out of place because I wasn't in a sorority, just was dating a guy in the frat. Thankfully I begged my bf at the time to bring me home before the formal and I changed to a better dress.  Anyway, I tend to be an overdresser. In college I felt more comfortable dressed how I wanted to rather than in big tshirts and athletic shorts or leggings. At the office, I work with a bunch of old dudes that are wearing polos at their dressiest lol. I'm perfectly fine being the odd one out there.  I think it's mostly rude to overdress whenever there's a stated dresscode. Like in my first example, I wouldn't call it "rude" but it definitely looked off.
text:I have been frustrated attending events like that as a plus-one, because my BF doesn't really understand that specific levels of dress code actually mean different things.

text:Discussion: LGBTQIA+ Signaling, Presentation, and Commodification in Fashion	labels:I'm a too femme to function lesbian and stereotypical queer fashion always leaves me feeling left out in the cold. I don't like how I look in flannel and doc martens. I really do like how I look in an embroidered satin maxi skirt.  Going back in time, I used to feel like I had only two options : butch or look straight. It was not a fun choice. Neither was right for me. I spent a lot of high school looking way more masculine than I really felt comfortable with. It was partway through college that I realized that I had a third choice. Perform the hell out of stereotypical feminity. Embrace the chiffon and satin but do it on my own terms.  I don't look exactly like your average straight woman these day. It's subtle but there's a difference. Well there's also the fact that I dress like I'm an escapee from a Victorian brothel. I play with feminity. I wear petticoats beneath skirts and dye my hair blue. It's not the same kind of feminitity as a the average straight lady. It's a conscious performance of femme and not an uncritical acceptance of gender norms. It works for me.	episode_done:True

text:Can you have a clothing style without actually wearing that certain style much?	labels:This isn‚Äôt a direct answer to your question, but I‚Äôve found I have a ‚Äòhopeful‚Äô sense of style and a ‚Äòrealistic‚Äô sense of style.  Hopeful-me will think about buying a teal floral wrap dress because it‚Äôs gorgeous. Realistic-me knows it will sit in my closet untouched for 3 years because I don‚Äôt wear teal!   I‚Äôve learned to differentiate between the two while I shop, at least. If I was a celebrity suddenly, maybe I would lean towards hopeful-me‚Äôs style, but for now I am normal and realistic!
text:I think of this kind of the other way around. I have work clothes and I have rest-of-the-time clothes that are my real preference.

text:If money were no object? Bespoke or haute couture?	labels:In this hypothetical I'd go with haute couture. In your friend's situation I'd keep looking until I found a designer I liked. Bespoke would be my last option for a couple of reasons. Your friend wants contemporary fashion, but most bespoke tailors make traditional clothes for a typically older crowd (you're in NYC though so there are some bespoke tailors catering to a younger crowd; make sure you look for them specifically). The bespoke tailors catering to a younger crowd don't have designs as good as high end ready to wear IMO. Tailoring and designing are different skills, and there's a reason Louis Vuittion, YSL, Dior, Gucci, etc pay their head designers millions per year. Of course some $4000 coats are worth more than others, so it would be good to know a bit about general quality.  Personally, I prioritize design over fit. I can deal with a less than perfect fit if I love the design of a piece. But I won't wear a piece if I don't love the design, even if it fits well.   The middle ground option is made to measure, or MTM. MTM for outerwear isn't as common for suiting, but it's out there.

text:Advice needed: How to keep up with trends without social media?	labels:Your best bet is going old school and following blogs. Set up an RSS feed, find people you like, and follow fashion that way.   But this is also a good time for you to explore YOUR personal style, without the influence of... uh... influencers. Obviously some of the fun of fashion is finding out what the trends are as dictated by other people, but with a little freedom from those, you might create silhouettes and combinations that are far more interesting to you personally than whatever's popping off on IG this week.  You can also do what I do and set up an IG that's just for this kind of thing. I don't follow anyone I know, I don't post anything on there. It's just for me to keep up with fashion, some bands I like, and a few owls managed to sneak their way in there. If you set up something like that, you can set aside an hour on the weekend and get caught up on fashion stuff without even installing the app on your phone. A lot of influencers are on YouTube too, so if you'd prefer to stay away from IG altogether, you can just look for their YouTube pages and watch their content on the weekend.

text:Is anyone into MBTI? Do you feel like your fashion preferences align with your personality type?	labels:At one point on the INTP subreddit everyone was talking about how they wish they could wear a cape without it being seen as weird. I would interpret the INTP relationship to fashion as a little bit more nuanced than "drab and careless". I think the common theme is that INTPs don't generally care what others think - and so that can manifest on a spectrum from "wears whatever because does not care about their appearance at all" to "wears completely outlandish things because they care about their appearance but do not care at all what others think of it".      As an INTP myself I fall somewhere between the two. Like... I *want* fashion to be a higher priority for me, but when it comes down to it my attitude is more often just "whatever" because social pressure to look good  doesn't register to me nearly as much as it could.
text:Wow. Another INTP here, when I read the title of this post I thought ‚Äúnah, not everything relates to personality‚Äù. But this actually describes my relationship with fashion perfectly. Also I would totally wear a cape if it wasn‚Äôt seen as weird.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:General Discussion - November 28, 2020	labels:Been looking for a particular style of coat for over a year. Couldn't find anything similar as the original inspiration was years old. Finally settled on something "close enough" that I was happy with, spent over a month exchanging the size to get it right, finalized everything and took the tags off last week.  Then today I walked past The Kooples on the way to the bathroom and saw the exact fucking coat I wanted 50% off, roughly what I paid for the first coat. Fit perfectly off the rack. For fuck's sake.  I am now poor.

text:Buying vs selling on resell websites	labels:I buy/sell on eBay, Poshmark, depop, and Mercari. There are pros and cons to all of them. For me I‚Äôm not trying to make money or save money necessarily‚ÄîI just want to recycle clothes that didn‚Äôt work for me and from everything I‚Äôve read most donated clothes end up in landfills. I also prefer to buy secondhand for similar reasons.   Poshmark definitely has the best customer service. I‚Äôve dealt with a lot of bad sellers (listing the wrong size, clothes not as described etc) and whenever I‚Äôve reached out to Poshmark they basically refund all my money and let me keep the item. On the flip side, as a seller people have unnecessarily complained (item didn‚Äôt fit) and Poshmark didn‚Äôt allow them to send the item back for a refund‚Äîmaybe Poshmark gave them a refund and let them keep the item but I wasn‚Äôt effected. This is something that REALLY irritates me about eBay‚Äîthey always take the side of the buyer and u end up having wasted time, money etc shipping something even when u aren‚Äôt at fault. I really wish eBay would absorb the costs like Poshmark does, but this is probably why Poshmark has the highest fees.  Ultimately I think the downfall of Poshmark will be the wholesalers and people who are doing it as a side hustle. It‚Äôs becoming harder and harder for sellers with 20-30 listings from their actual personal closet to sell things because there‚Äôs so much garbage for buyers to sift through. It‚Äôs also hard for me as a buyer to find bundles anymore. In the early days sellers closets were made up of actual clothes from their closets so they were all the same size and the style of the person selling. Now if I find something I like it‚Äôs impossible to find another item in someone‚Äôs closet because there are 500 random listings to sift through.

text:Winter staples?	labels:Depends how cold it gets, and how much time you plan to spend outside! I'm a city girl and a bit of an "indoor cat," so my main winter activities involve navigating public transit, dealing with puddles of slush, and an occasional walk on icy sidewalks. We don't plan to drive or live in a detached house any time soon, which cuts out a whole category of winter chores.  So for me, staples are long wool coats, wool turtlenecks, wool socks and shiny black rain boots or sturdy shearling lined Timberland boots. For extra warmth, I wrap a wool pashmina around my head and layer silk thermals under my clothes. Mittens annoy me so I usually just wear leather gloves or keep my hands in my pockets. I find this is the best compromise to stay warm without too much bulk or any technical garments. If the pavements are dry, I'll even switch to heeled leather boots.  I've walked up to 30 minutes at a time in weather around 10¬∞ Fahrenheit in an outfit like this, with the scarf pulled up over my nose and mouth. (The normalisation of face masks will make this even easier now.) But it would *absolutely not* be sufficient for extended time in temperatures below 0¬∞ Fahrenheit, winter sports, or even for things like shoveling snow or scraping a windshield. For that you'd want taller insulated boots and a proper down jacket.	episode_done:True
text:General Tips To Spice Up Wardrobe	labels:Look around your wardrobe to see if you can put together any monochromatic outfits. People do this all the time with black.

"Layer it" -- ah, the standard cliche. 5. "Wear it with this expensive moncler vest, who cares if it looks good? That logo is GIGANTIC!" 6. Two completely different suggestions, one of which is their second unhelpful cliche. Somebody clearly took the photo first and they wrote the tip afterwards. 7. "Play with color." Oh, gee, really? I was only going to wear a white shirt and gray trousers with a navy blazer, ever, but gee, you want me to *consider things*? Cool. Thanks. Super helpful, Mr. P. 8. "More formality" -- shows a wide-open denim shirt, sunglasses, a mess of bracelets under an open wrist...  Yay, I caught 'em all, what do I win?

text:How do I feel more comfortable "dressing up"?	labels:Actually, this is a great time to address this. Once you come out of the pandemic, people will have somewhat forgotten what your normal is so you can set a new tone. Dress it up the first few times you see people and it will set the tone for a new normal. No one will even think it's weird because I bet everyone is sitting at home just wishing they would wear anything other than sweats. So, for the first couple of times at least, make sure you dress up. After that it'll be your normal. I kinda dealt with this too. I live in the bay area, the most people wear here are jeans and a tee. I hate it so will go with dresses and other things often and feel really overdressed. I realized that for me the best way to not feel weird about that was to dress down my shoes. So wearing ankle boots was the fanciest I would go with shoes and that was only on rare occasions. Most of the time I would pair sandals or sneakers with my outfits and look like I fit in again.	episode_done:True

I'm a bit too old to go trick-or-treating, so I'll be giving out candy in it if any kids come to the door. I can also hide my real mask under the gas mask, which is cool. The only major piece I'm missing is the pants (the greatcoat covers a lot of the legs), and I would also love to make a pair of vienot lenses for the gas mask, which are those spider-web eyes that stop the lenses from blowing inwards from the concussion effects of explosives.	episode_done:True

My husband usually wears linen shorts but would need to get some new, longer pants for a potential new job.

Didn't really wear it from about age 18-26, but it's still a fantastic piece that I wore regularly to work and will again.

text:I‚Äôd like to preface all this by saying I don‚Äôt know where else to post this on Reddit. I figure the best method to achieve the end goal is to branch out and see if anything comes back. I‚Äôd also like to preface the following: I rarely ask favors of people as it‚Äôs always been my understanding not to lean on others for help. However, I‚Äôm dead in the water. I‚Äôve attempted to complete this mission myself, but it‚Äôs not lead anywhere significant because of level of importance this person possesses. I was hoping the Reddit community could play a part in accomplishing it with me. I‚Äôve always seen Reddits and watched a bunch of the videos of the community on YouTube. Honestly you are a bunch fun loving individuals and have accomplished crazy things from what I‚Äôve seen.  From working on a nuclear reactor, to climbing Mt. Everest, and even diving in a submarine to 1,500 get below the oceans surface: nothing has made me shake or to be as nervous as my dream of meeting Thom Browne. I would like to meet Thom Browne.(Fashion designer and business mogul) I have two of his known addresses but as a man of that importance I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôs not at either typically with all the international business he conducts. I‚Äôd also like to point out that I‚Äôm currently a nuclear engineer in the U.S. Navy. There are a few restrictions I have due to this. Therefore, I cannot have a computer. I‚Äôd further my investigation through those means if those were viable.  Since I‚Äôve joined the Navy, I‚Äôve not been able to keep up the development of my programming and hacking skills. My heart would have immense renitence if I didn‚Äôt ask you this: Can you find a way to put me in contact with Thom Browne? Anything would help; from his personal cell phone, to being in the same room, or his future known future location, etc... You will be compensated handsomely at the end of this daring mission.

text:MFA Style Starter Packs - User edition	labels:This is gonna be a list for me, it's gonna be partly aspirational since I lack a few things as I want to finish losing weight before buying everything. Going to do it to cover my current job with a smart casual dress code on the smart side and occasionally in a suit. Basically what I would go out and buy if I suddenly lost *all* my clothes and needed to start over.    1x charcoal suit   1x pair black Oxfords   2x white shirts spread collar barrel cuffs, 1 twill 1 poplin   1x navy grenadine tie   1x Mac raincoat   1x navy Chesterfield   1x pair of grey peccary gloves, cashmere lining   1x mid grey cashmere scarf   1x mid grey merino v neck or cardigan   1x navy merino v neck or cardigan   1x pair dark brown plain toe Derbys   1x pair mid-dark brown Chelseas   1x pair mid-dark brown loafers   1x mid grey flannel trousers   1x stone or khaki linen trousers   3x light blue OCBDs   2x white OCBDs   2x light blue pinpoint Oxford shirts   1x navy blazer   1x navy Harrington   1x navy Shetland jumper   2x white tees   2x grey tees   1x grey sweatshirt   2x checked flannel shirts   2x linen shirts   1x pair of trainers   1x dark wash jeans   3x chinos, khaki stone and olive   1x casual coat, either peacoat, duffel or Balmacaan       Not the most exciting wardrobe ever, maybe more than needed for a start out, but I think this would provide a suitable core wardrobe for me if I had to start afresh.	episode_done:True
text:Shopping my own closet for the perfect tee	labels:I‚Äôm nosy about other people‚Äôs clothes so this is s great post for me! I also have a habit of holding on to things with little comfort issues like tight sleeves even if it means I don‚Äôt really wear them.
text:Haha I‚Äôm glad you enjoyed it! I also love seeing other people‚Äôs closets. Uncomfortable sleeves are the worst... I used to do that all the time too because ‚Äúit‚Äôs a perfectly good piece of clothing‚Äù but it‚Äôs not helpful at all if you‚Äôre not going to wear it. (Or worse if you wear it and are uncomfortable all day).	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What are novelty leather keyrings/keychains for? How do you use them?	labels:I have just three keys but a huge everyday bag, so I bought a big keychain just so that I can find my keys easier.

Other than those three reasons, I wouldn‚Äôt know why people need key chains.	episode_done:True

text:Boba's Ultra Basic Steps For Developing Style and Outfits (version 1)	labels:This is a fantastic resource Boba! You‚Äôve put into words a lot of the smaller aspects of looking at construction outfits really perfectly, I‚Äôd consider myself at least marginally better dressed and this is still a really helpful method of approaching fashion.  >What is your relationship with gender and identity within fashion?  In particular may be the hardest question to actually answer here(or maybe that‚Äôs just me), the past year or so I‚Äôve very much been questioning my sexuality and as a whole I‚Äôve never exactly felt like I identified with or liked traditional masculinity, I‚Äôd say my current wardrobe leans much more heavily into categorically masculine items and fit and it‚Äôs def something I‚Äôve been wanting to shift away from.   I‚Äôm like tiny and prefer high crops anyway so I really need to just start embracing more womenswear but I‚Äôm lazy and haven‚Äôt bothered to learn about womenswear brands uet
text:Thank you for the kind words :) I wrote the list and even I will go back through and do my own homework assignment because I think categorizing your tastes and then zooming back can be a great way to guide you through your own aesthetic. Doing fashion can become so overwhelming!  And yes that is a heavy hitter of a question. As a queer person I also have been wondering what my relationship to "mens"wear is. I ordered my first women's shirt a few months back and wow is it liberating. My answer to that question would be that I like to kind of blend things from the now decaying bi-gender system. In the same outfit I like to wear feminine clothing right next to something that I perceive as masculine (here in the midwest athleisure is the most masculine dress type) because with my minimalist, meditative taste I think it can look chic and balanced. :) thank you for sharing your experience.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Model poses while online shopping	labels:They do that when the fit if the garment is inferior. It is intentional.  Beware items that have this kind of photography, because most of the time it means the garment has bad construction, weird seam placement, or unfortunate details.  Well constructed items are not shot in this manner. Brands want to show off their excellent construction. It is known.  Hope that helps!
text:I came here to say this. I was a Nordstrom catalog model for 15 years, amongst others. And normal fitting clothes were shot with basic poses, anything that was weird was clipped on me to hell and I had to do a weird jump or crouch or something.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Women that work labor jobs, what parts of your wardrobe are most important to you?	labels:Good comfortable shoes for me, definitely! I work with cleaning. This is the only part of my job clothes that doesn't have any particular guidelines from the company, so we buy these ourselves.  I live in Sweden, and here you basically never have to personally pay for the kind of work attire you are required to wear. If it's free to choose, you may have to buy those things for yourself.

I need to wear diapers some days which kinda messes with the fit some days making the jeans not go as high on the waist as I would like.A woman friend suggested high waisted jeans but I can‚Äôt think of a time I‚Äôve seen a guy in those before.  Also a little worried about buying things without trying them on but that is what I will be doing because if Covid.  USA. Not wanting to spend more than 40-50 on a pair.

text:What do you think about having a signature style vs. a variety of looks?	labels:I have three or four distinct styles. Most of the time I like wearing dark, edgy punk-inspired clothes. However, I‚Äôm a style chameleon. If I need to be professional, I have a whole separate wardrobe of high-quality suiting. Take out my piercings, and I‚Äôll have anyone fooled that that‚Äôs the realest me. In the summer and family gatherings I often wear more earthy boho and beachy surfer looks. Fashion is a great tool for self-expression, matching the mood, and setting the mood.
text:I'm convinced that there's something deeper than just boho styled, edgy, punk, professional styled etc. that we find ourselves liking, that creates our style.   Like music. There's something deeper than simply genre that makes me like a song. It's not genres that define my music taste. It's a combination of all my songs I like that creates my taste.	labels:You are 100% on point with your analysis, so much so it requires rumination.	episode_done:True

text:What do you think are the pieces of jewelry everyone should own?	labels:Please never take advice from "X things everyone should own" lists. There is nothing everyone "should" own. Not diamonds, not pearls, none of it.   It's all based on your own preferences, needs, and lifestyle.  What do YOU like? What is your personality like? What do you wear? What kind of lifestyle do you have? What is your fashion style and "look" like? What are your undertones? What is your budget?  Answering those questions may help someone give you advice regarding jewelry. Prescriptive "everyone should own" lists are completely worthless.
text:You are so right!   My signature clothing style is Boho/Cowgirl/Hippie, so even though I own the pearls and diamond studs, I‚Äôve not worn them in years. However my Native American squash blossoms, Navajo pearls and turquoise cuff bracelets get worn literally everywhere, every day.

text:inspo album for city boys: popeye magazine	labels:I always find it interesting how Popeye take a classic item or style from one place and frame it or style it in a Japanese way. Usually looks good but when it‚Äôs a look that comes from the same country as me it can be pretty hit or miss. They did a football (soccer) style sample with English football shirts and scarves and just looked ridiculous to me.

A velvet cami from SheIn before it was popular haha, I eventually got more colours and they‚Äôre still holding strong a couple of years later.  Knit sandals from amazon, fav purchase ever! SO COMFY  And a polyester dress I bought from a bazaar in latin america, it‚Äôs ugly but it has some beachy vibes to it that I cant resist.	episode_done:True
text:What did people *actually* wear in 2000's?	labels:From 2001-2005, clothing I wore as a high schooler/college kid: low rise bootcut jeans, fitted graphic tshirts, fitted polo shirts, fitted shirts in general (shirts were so tight- maybe that‚Äôs why we layered??), always layering shirts- and shirts were super long and over your hips, but tight- never tucking them in, cutoff denim skirts, cotton shorts (like soffees) with words on the butt, necklace with my first initial on it, platform flip flops, dresses with Hawaiian prints (like flowers or surfers etc), hoop earrings, fitted hoodies. That‚Äôs what I can remember.
text:> shirts were super long and over your hips, but tight- never tucking them in  This. Crop tops was not a thing after the late 90s and really early 00s until they were brought back recently. Meanwhile jackets and hoodies are at waist length so you get that layered effect from your tee always sticking out.	labels:	episode_done:True

I'm wondering if the association with more garish colors related in their minds to foreign trade and is maybe more about how they feel towards external cultures.
text:The list is basically the full set of colors they would have been able to use when factoring in dye performance (particularly color stability) . It even maps to pre-Twentieth-Century advice on house paint.  There may have been some dyes they could acquire at expense and use on clothing reserved for special occasions (and thus less roughly used), but their association of formality with monochrome obviated such luxuries. It'd be like buying a purple silk velvet tuxedo today.	labels:	episode_done:True

Nothing really authoritative for those of us who are in between the two :(	episode_done:True
text:what pieces/brands did you buy when moving from a warmer climate to a cooler climate? what did you end up regretting/not using?	labels:You‚Äôll want a coat that reaches at least mid thigh. Butts get cold real quick when your jacket stops at your belt.
text:If you‚Äôre not yet ready to commit to investing in an expensive good quality winter coat (long ones are indeed more expensive!) before you get to feel out conditions for your new climate‚Äîan intermediate solution I recommend is that you wear a light/thinner puffer & a waterproof rain coat over it. Your puffer will keep you warm (and you can wear it solo on clear days) and the raincoat will give you snow/wind protection. They will also trap heat and warm the *air* surrounding your body, which is key!  Costco base layers are also wonderful quality and super affordable (and I think you can get them delivered online). I wore them on a pre-pan trip to Iceland during NOVEMBER and I would have to like race to rip them off when we got indoors because I would begin literally sweating lol but so warm when outside!	labels:Even a fleece and a raincoat will keep you warm.

text:What are your not-so-basic basics to pair with statement pieces?	labels:I usually wear one statement piece with more basic items, but if I want to combine more dramatic items, I try to pick items that stand out for different reasons (unless I'm going for full on maximalist).   So like with the pink suit, it's 100% the colour that makes it stand out. So I would pair it with a top with a bold pattern, or a dramatic scarf that creates an interesting silhouette, or a belt or necklace that has a lot of interesting detail.

text:Clarks Released a "Desert Boot 2" - They Look Pretty Nice, What does Everybody Think?	labels:This might be heresy, but I actually prefer the Bushacres over the old and new CDB, having had multiple pairs of both. I originally bought the Bushacre just because they were cheaper, but ultimately came to like it better.   The crepe sole looks nice out of the box, but it just gets dirty and nasty looking IME.

Also which color did you choose? Literally on the cusp of buying this belt lol :)	labels:If you wear it around your waist only, not the hips it would be ok.

text:One Can Never Have Enough Socks - Happy Holidays MFA	labels:I know the last pic is a meme, but I found an unopened pack of them at goodwill and they are my absolute favorite to wear day to day.

Additionally, while they have definitely worn down, none have developed holes in them yet, even the ones I first bought.	episode_done:True
text:When will I be "too old" to look cute, cool, hip, whatever?	labels:As you get older you stop caring as much about that stuff. Focus on developing your style now at a young age and the rest will kind of fall in place. As you get older you‚Äôll already know what you like and what works well for your body. There won‚Äôt be a need to ‚Äúlook‚Äù hip or cool because you‚Äôll just...be.	episode_done:True

text:How did you find your style/tips for a cohesive style	labels:Who I am is not defined by my outfits. If I have very different styles on different days it really doesn't matter. There are days when I leave the house wearing a corset, hoop skirt and three layers of petticoats. There are days when I leave the house in jeans and a t-shirt. I am still the exact same person.  A fashion style cannot tell you who you are. You have to know who you are first.   As far as the practicalities of merging different aesthetics, my approach is that I have a spectrum of  "looking like an escapee from a medieval vampire brothel" to "average 2020s adult woman". I mix things up between those based on how much attention I want to draw and what I need to do for the day. It's okay if things are perfectly cohesive. Nobody cares that much about a slightly gothy accessory on an otherwise unremarkable outfit unless I draw from way on the goth end of the spectrum. I get away with wearing medieval kirtles on public and no one cares. I get away with wearing medieval kirtles and modern boots and hats and no one cares. I also get away with wearing cauls and suits. No one cares.  People don't actually pay that much attention to other people's clothes. Which means that you can get away with a lot and no one will notice. Clashing really isn't as big of a problem as people think it ism
text:I don't care how people see me, i want to feel good with what I'm wearing and i want it to be cohesive, but that's just my personal preference. I know people don't notice fashion inconsistencies because I don't and i also don't care much for what other people wear, i want everyonre to express themselves however they see fit. Of course, who i am is not defined by my outfits either but it is an expression of what i like and i have a hard time transforming that into the outside.

I just had to keep receipts, and subtract the cost when we got home. Besides cutting down on ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt really need this‚Äù arguments, I actually ended up learning some useful lessons from the process‚Äîin order to set my budget for the year, it was my job to figure out what I needed and lay out a proposal, which was negotiating practice (my sister and I competed to see who could get a bigger one approved!), and we had to use Excel to log everything.

text:My thoughts as this came up in another thread: SHEIN is mostly dropshipped, but if you *only* buy SHEIN clothes on sale you're often getting it at the same price as what it sells for on AliExpress without paying a lot for shipping *and* you don't have to wait a month or more for it to arrive from China.    I've ordered from both AE and SHEIN and tbh getting everything in one package in a week vs 10 packages that may or may not show up between 1-2 months after the order date is one thing that SHEIN does right.     Do I think it's a good company? No. But I'm a broke bitch who can't afford nice staple pieces, esp with my weight fluctuating so much due to covid and being depresso.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:What are your thoughts on outfit repeating multiple days in a row?	labels:I think the pressure is to not be "strange/unaware of your appearance" or more likely not to look "poor/can't afford more clothes." Some people do notice, and the rude ones point it out. This perception starts young. Growing up, there were teachers and other school staff who repeated outfits and other children loudly pointed it out.  I repeat outfits as much as possible if I'm not seeing the same people (my household doesn't count). The internal pressure is strong to not repeat within a few weeks of seeing the same people to avoid potential comments.
text:I had a teacher in high school who I realized basically had a capsule wardrobe for work - she had like 7 tops, a few cardigans, a few dresses and a couple pairs of pants/jeans and like one skirt. They all matched each other and she mixed them up so that she had a different outfit every day. I didn't notice until like halfway through the school year but once I did I thought it was pretty cool, and a great way to look nice for work and save money. She always looked good!	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Plants and Fashion: A Marriage of Obsessions	labels:I love plants, and really enjoy leaf as a print in addition to florals. I think it‚Äôs nice to pull from nature besides flowers. However, I can‚Äôt stand the prints of monsteras on everything. To me it feels a bit lazy and literally just sticking it on because they know plants are popular now. the monsters pieces I‚Äôve seen have not seemed thoughtful in the pattern choice. Anyone else feeling that?   I think a lot of it will burn itself out as a fad, but hope the fun prints with leaves and different florals stick around a bit longer.

text:Bruce Boyer on Finding Your Wardrobe and Sustainability in Fashion ‚Äì Put This On (Derek Guy )	labels:i wish articles like this avoided the "expensive clothes sustainability" trope. the systems that lead to people being able to drop several thousand on a suit are inherently not sustainable, and i would love to see more discussion like that in the last question where consumption itself is addressed. imo the answer will involve more people taking responsibility for the origin of their own clothing with a focus on local labor and materials
text:Could you say more about why those systems are unsubstainablr?   I'm not very rich, I would struggle to afford a house in my expensive city, but I have dropped a few thousand on a suit - made with good materials by a local bespoke maker.  I think extreme wealth gaps are unsustainable, for sure, but dropping a few thousand on a suit every couple of years isn't much more than people spend on a computer, out drinking, or on games and gaming systems. For me, it's a hobby I get to wear.	labels:One decent suit in any closet is always a must, a couple of times I got the job I was interviewing for simply because I wore a suit and tie to the interview.   Sustainability and changing trends are another can of worms which depend on the individual. Contemporary vs Classic, $300 suit which can be altered by a tailor vs $4,000.00 fitted suit. Like he said ‚Äúbuy the best you can afford and take care of your purchases‚Äù
text:> is always a must  It's not anymore though. For so many people wearing a suit just isn't needed outside of maybe a handful of events a year and at that point why bother spending anything more than a couple hundred?   You don't need a full canvas suit that's been made out of a fabric you picked for your measurements. Just like buy a navy worsted wool suit from J Crew on steep discount or any of the other many budget brands for suiting out there now.  You can vary easily do more than just get by with a suit that many people who browse here wouldn't even bother calling "decent". Many might not even need a suit at all. I can't remember the last time I needed to wear one.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Fashion to help your changing body and lifestyle?	labels:Addressing the body change: I too gained a decent amount of weight in my mid twenties due to getting an office job. One of the biggest breakthroughs I had in terms of my style was accepting my new body/silhouette and figuring out what cuts work for my new body. With that extra weight, I ended up loving the way I looked in long, dark pencil skirts paired with a tucked in top. Additionally, I stopped caring about the number or the size of the garment. Sometimes I needed a size M, sometimes I needed a size XL. Once I got over that mental hurdle, shopping was so much easier.   &#x200B;  Addressing the lifestyle change: Not sure if this is the advice you wanted to hear, but this is what worked for me. My younger self's style was not office appropriate at all. I was into short sundresses and plunging necklines. My big "ah-hah" moment was realizing that I can have two styles. At work, I'm a walking advertisement for J.Crew and I feel so confident. Outside of work, I'm in a short dress and high heels. The trick for me was realizing that my body can pull off different silhouettes depending on the style. I enjoy form fitting outfits in my office wardrobe. Conversely, I enjoy flowy outfits in my non-office wardrobe.

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - November 12, 2020	labels:Hey Everyone,   I'm torn between getting a black or a charcoal overcoat. I know the general consensus here is that charcoal is more versatile - which I definitely agree with - but though I feel like charcoal would be a 8/10 choice with loads of outfits and that I could just casually grab it with just about whatever I'm wearing (usually either dark indigo or black denim), I feel like black would be a 10/10 when done very well (I.e. with a red and black flannel shirt over a white t shirt).   Do you guys agree? Have you ever had to choose between versatility vs a much smaller number of slightly better (at least in my head, though lockdown prevents me from trying them on) outfits? Let me know what you think, and thanks in advance.
text:I generally lean towards just buying pieces that I like the look of regardless of versatility, at some point when you have your style nailed down well enough you‚Äôre capable of knowing what‚Äôs going to fit your wardrobe well and only owning ‚Äústatement pieces‚Äù is way more fun than trying to min/max versatility, if you think you‚Äôd enjoy owning a black overcoat more it‚Äôs worth considering, that said   >[a black overcoat] with a red and black flannel shirt over a white t shirt  Does not read as a ‚Äú10/10‚Äù fit to me	labels:	episode_done:True

I think when on sale (and they have a ton of sales, for example 50% everything during the off xmas season, 40% off black friday), they offer a very good price to quality ratio.  I highly recommend them for their henleys and button down shirts, especially the oxfords. they can be found with out logo too.	episode_done:True
text:How do you balance bright statement pieces with a capsule wardrobe?	labels:Expand your definition of "statement piece" to include texture, pattern, silhouette, and x-factors instead of just colors vs neutrals. A shiny pant makes a statement even if it's black. An oversized blazer makes a statement even if it's tan. A snake print bag or skirt  makes a statement even if it's shades of brown or grey.   Some other ideas that might help: make color decisions based on seasons - if you have a lot of winterwear you love in a certain color scheme, start there and weed out what doesn't go with those faves, and so on with the other seasons. Make pinterest boards with the colors you're considering. Take pictures of combinations you like. Consider what colors you like best on yourself.	episode_done:True

text:General Discussion - December 23, 2020	labels:Oh trust me, I will gatekeep because it‚Äôs proved to be the only way to ensure the existence of standards.  And I don‚Äôt care about what you say you are. Fedoras/Dusters/Capes/whatever is not just clothing. It‚Äôs an entire lifestyle and subculture that you are unlikely to be privy to or even fit into if you lack the euphoria and pedigree. That‚Äôs just the reality.  You‚Äôre probably one of those people who believes anybody can be anything yada yada yada. Sorry to break it to you, but no matter how much I want to be, say, a gentlesir, it simply isn‚Äôt going to happen. I can don the wolf shirts all I want, but it doesn‚Äôt change the fact that because it isn‚Äôt who I was born, it‚Äôs something I‚Äôll never be. The same goes for most of the people on this subreddit who, by most accounts, even detest and reject the trappings of class that can not be divorced from euphoria. It is a style of, by, and for the American lower basement class and below, and nothing you say will change that.   It‚Äôs literally a costume for most of the people on this sub, and frankly, it‚Äôs subversive and I despise it.
text:What have I done?	labels:Here's the thing. You said a "trilby is a fedora."  Is it in the same family? Yes. No one's arguing that.  As someone who is a haberdasher who studies classy hats, I am telling you, specifically, in science, no one calls trilbies fedoras. If you want to be "specific" like you said, then you shouldn't either. They're not the same thing.  If you're saying "fedora family" you're referring to the taxonomic grouping of fedorae, which includes things from porkpies to safari hats to cool indiana jones hats.  So your reasoning for calling a trilby a fedora is because random people "call the classy hats fedoras?" Let's get pith hats and tricorns in there, then, too.  Also, calling something a duster or trench coat? It's not one or the other, that's not how taxonomy works. They're both. A trilby is a trilby and a member of the fedora family. But that's not what you said. You said a trilby is a fedora, which is not true unless you're okay with calling all members of the fedora family fedoras, which means you'd call porkpies, Safari hats, and other hats fedoras, too. Which you said you don't.  It's okay to just admit you're wrong, you know?	episode_done:True
text:What are your favorite straight leg jeans?	labels:I just got my first pair of the Levis Wedgie Icon jean and I am.... deeply in love. I haven't felt this way about a pair of pants in years. They are perfect -- straight (but still a little tapered), hits at my ankle for length, high rise, rigid denim. I have them in the Charleston Stroll wash which is a pretty standard blue jean color, but I have already looked at getting them in a black or gray wash for winter. A+ would recommend.
text:Hey, do you find that they stretch out in the waist after wear?	labels:>stretch out  This is 100% what happened to me. I plan to get a smaller size when I can and bearing the 2-3 months of discomfort so that I can keep the amazing leg fit that they offer for longer.	episode_done:True

text:Does anyone else feel that nothing is unfashionable nowadays?	labels:The present always feels ‚Äúneutral‚Äù. I think if you watch any reality show from the early 2010s, even as late as 2014-15, you‚Äôll see a big difference from what was considered ‚Äúno defining silhouette‚Äù then. things like just a tshirt change slightly in cut and shape over time.
text:Yeah, exactly. Like I would say the most fashionable t-shirt cut a few years ago was a v-neck with capped sleeves. Before that, a very long v-neck with longer fitted sleeves (think American Apparel). Now I would speculate that it's either a fitted cropped crew-neck or an over-sized unisex t-shirt. I'm not saying people only wear those types of ts at those times, but that's what is and was most current.     I do think that trends are changing more quickly and thus fewer people can (or bother to) keep up so wearing the exactly what's in vogue right this second is less important than it used to be.     I also think that younger people tend to prioritize being on trend more. Teens in particular are usually still growing so they need new clothes more often anyway. As you get older and spend more time around other older people, your definition of "current" changes. More formal clothing tends to be more timeless too, so once you're wearing work wear 5 days a week the definition of "current" seems to shift.	labels:>Like I would say the most fashionable t-shirt cut a few years ago was a v-neck with capped sleeves.

Oh holy shit, that's such an on point observation though! I still *have* a couple of these v-neck tshirts, which I bought in the first half of the 10s mostly. But I don't really wear them anymore, since most of my basic tshirts nowadays are boxier, more unisex like tshirts with a higher neckline.

text:TheRealReal x Gucci	labels:It‚Äôs not generous. $1 for items priced $300-$15000? They have a huge margin.   Also, the Real Real regularly puts the market price/retail price for goods higher than they actually are so that the goods are only a few dollars cheaper than new.   I‚Äôm sure people can find deals from time to time but I‚Äôm not a fan of the site.
text:I find TheRealReal useful for a few things - my Mary Katrantzou love has been well served! - but they selling things like Outdoor Voices for literally the same as retail AND you'd have to pay their shipping costs which would exceed how much it costs to get it from OV.  Def only useful for *very* specific things.   If I use them, I try to only go for designers not super popular for replicas because they've consistently been lax about checking for authenticity and if I want better replicas I might as well go on Taobao or WeChat.	labels:Wow I did not know that about their authentication system. Do you think Stella McCartney clothing are likely to be replicas on there?
text:Less likely for Stella in particular - they are (or were till at least 2019) an official reseller of those products so they were getting a lot of their inventory directly from Stella McCartney.   My gut is that there are certain products (Hermes/Gucci logo belts, Chanel quilted bags, a Burberry scarf) that are more likely to be dupes initially and it would be better to stay away from TRR and try to find it elsewhere.   TRR is currently facing several lawsuits about how they misled investors in how their authenticators are trained, Chanel also alleges that they filed off serial numbers as a practice.	labels:	episode_done:True

A lot of the outfits/lookbooks that are posted give me "fashion week" vibes because it has something vintage, baggy pants, some obscure sweater, etc.  I'm not hating on the subreddit because I respect fashion but the subreddit doesn't seem to be what it was 5 years ago.

I would like them in white too but I'm trying to steer away from leather, if anyone knows some faux leather dupes let me know!	episode_done:True

text:Derek Guy: The Crown‚Äôs ‚ÄòBalmoral Test‚Äô Barbours Are Not Just Jackets	labels:Its a wonderful jacket, a Barbour. There are nicer ones, but I've got a second hand one that's about twice as old as I am that's still going, and really quite warm. Its even got steel rods along the edges of the pocket so you can lock them together and make a little satchel for shotgun cartridges. I'm not into that shite but it's a lovely little feature to still be working after 50+ years	episode_done:True
text:Throwback Thursday: Revisiting "A Primer on Materials"	labels:I think it'd be worth mentioning the difference between the material and the construction/weave because it's easy to mix things up.   Like when people say something is smooth because it's silk, but really, it's smooth because it's satin. Just like how raw silk noil isn't smooth even though it's silk.
text:I think some information on the different weaves and varieties of fabric and what materials they can be made out of would be super useful. I agree that most people tend to equate silk with materials like satin or charmeuse when silks like noil or dupioni aren't as smooth or shiny. Also, I think a discussion on fabric grain and concepts like twill and other weaves would be helpful for people hoping to avoid clothing with mismatched grain that doesn't sit or wash right. Grain is super important to how the material behaves and it's something a lot of clothing manufacturers are sloppy about.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:General Discussion - December 28, 2020	labels:Really thick into quarantine and realized I don't really have anyone to talk about fashion with anymore. It's kind of a bummer being excited about clothes and not being able to talk about it. Makes me actually want to start posting pics on WAYWT.   Been slowly replacing my closet with a lot of Todd Snyder and don't know how to feel about it lol, always wanted a "cool designer" closet but from a cost and functionality stand point it's not very doable. Good staples just get more wear in my closet, got to pick up more stand out pieces so I don't feel boring!

text:Difficulty distinguishing between so 'idealized' style and personal style?	labels:I moved back home earlier this year and as a result had a much reduced storage situation. I sorted my clothes into three categories,wear,don‚Äôt wear often (or at all) and doesn‚Äôt fit.  I donated the truly ill fitting items and my sister picked out some items she liked.  The last category I put in a drawer and wore each one throughout a month and noted what I was drawn to and what I liked especially the items I had purchased for ‚Äòfantasy me‚Äô.   Mixing them with familiar clothing helped make them more accessible and actually a usable part of my wardrobe.   Essentially I now feel like I have a new wardrobe. Plus the notes I made meant I know what I actually like to wear more and therefore purchase in the future and what should definitely stay a fantasy item that I only like on IG or something.	episode_done:True
text:Your thoughts on leopard print (and animal prints in general)	labels:I love it, personally. Sitting here in a grey leopard print cardigan as I type! I used to have a similar perspective on leopard print (mid-20s here), but after seeing a few pieces I liked over the last few years, I decided to own it.   I typically don‚Äôt wear more than one animal print at a time, and my loudest piece is probably a cropped vintage leopard-print fur jacket. I used to be terrified of color, and while I‚Äôve made strides in that area, for a long time animal print was how I kept it interesting while wearing 5 shades of beige or grey.   My frequent fliers are a zebra print skirt, snake print pants, snake ankle boots, the aforementioned jacket, and a cheetah print sweater.	episode_done:True
text:Shopping for clothing items you already own: confessions of an outfit repeater	labels:I‚Äôve recently stopped doing this, actually! I was a sweater collector for years. Boxy crewnecks in super thick woven materials and weird patterns. I had like 50 for awhile, it was straight up out of hand. I‚Äôve finally stopped buying them and managed to part with most and actually wear through a few (and unfortunately stained several and never wore again, which happens to anything light colored that I own). Now I‚Äôve got a handful of good sweaters with enough room for another if I find one I *really* need.              All that said though, I‚Äôve gotten into my mid twenties and my body has changed so now I can barely even wear sweaters at all anymore because I‚Äôm too damn hot all the time. Has anybody else had this change too? I used to be cold all the time and now I‚Äôm roasting in a t shirt at 70 degrees.	episode_done:True
text:Is it disgusting to not wear socks with shoes?	labels:She's a jerk, but also it's better for the shoes if you wear no-show socks.

text:What‚Äôs a piece you bought before the pandemic, but haven‚Äôt worn a single time since because the occasion has been cancelled/we have literally nowhere to go?	labels:Pre-covid I was working at a winery where the dress code was 'dinner date' . I was really getting into dressing up for work and I was discovering the better I looked, the more tip money I made so I was investing money in dresses and seeing pretty good returns. Now I have a closet full of dresses that I sure hope to wear again some day ü§û	episode_done:True
text:What are your predictions for 2021 suit style?	labels:I would say that suits in general have been on the downtrend among white-collar types; a lot of jobs just don‚Äôt demand it anymore. I think the pandemic and bankruptcies you mentioned may push that trend further, but it was already on its way.  As far a changes in the style of common suits: I think super wide/skinny lapels are definitely on their way out (if they‚Äôre not already there), looser fits may make a comeback, and I feel that somewhat bolder colors might be a bit more popular.   As for the more fashion-forward: I feel like I‚Äôve been seeing more belted suits, skirt suits/skirts + blazers (on men; @ Harry Styles), and asymmetric details. Obviously that‚Äôs getting into the world of fashion show stuff, so it doesn‚Äôt influence most of us that much, but it‚Äôs worth talking about.
text:> I think the pandemic and bankruptcies you mentioned may push that trend further, but it was already on its way.  I actually wonder if the opposite will happen. After a year of sitting at home wearing sweatpants every day of the week people might be in the mood to dress up again and suiting could see a revival... maybe with more casual details to ease the transition? Unlined jackets, drawstring pants, patch pockets, stretch blend fabrics.	labels:That‚Äôs a possibility for sure, but I think only for a small group who really enjoys tailored clothing; I feel like the vast majority of guys really just see that sort of clothing as a burden. That said, I myself have been fleshing out my formalwear closet a lot since the pandemic started, so I hope to put it to use once I can :)	episode_done:True
text:What is your go-to favourite dress to wear in the cooler months?	labels:In the winter I love to wear oversized sweater dresses, long-sleeve skater or babydoll dresses, and pinafores over turtlenecks. I also often wear my spring/summer dresses with black tights underneath & a sweater on top.	episode_done:True
text:Your favourite men's style shopping "hacks"	labels:My ‚Äúhack‚Äù follows in line with yours.  I always recommend people look into blanks (I like rue porter), because as you grow up you start find yourself gravitating towards more subtle clothes rather than a big Nike check on the chest.     Additionally, I recommend looking for timeless pieces if you‚Äôre starting off a closet. Buy things that have stood the test of time, and will look good on anyone regardless of age.  For example: - a denim jacket - a leather jacket - black jeans - a well fitting white shirt   Lastly, a ‚Äúhack‚Äù I have is telling my friends to follow people that have the same body type as them. Some things look great on on body type but you buy it and you won‚Äôt understand why ya look like a saran wrap California roll.	episode_done:True
text:How do you guys who like a formal/business look manage to not look the same all the time?	labels:Two brands may be worth checking out: ADAY and Wildfang, depending on your style (I like both). I second and third the suggestion about accessories.

Soles that look grippy but are the most slippery things I've ever tried. I own leather bottomed mocs that brand new have better grip. Really frustrating	labels:	episode_done:True
text:How did you find your style/tips for a cohesive style	labels:I think it can be huge to just have a consistent color scheme, even if you wear different styles, if you do it all in similar colors then it will always look cohesive. It will allow you to combine more style-specific items together, like combining something vintage with something more modern, or something more edgy/rocker with something more frilly/soft.	episode_done:True
text:Shitpost Saturday: the Festival of Clothing	labels:Three nubbly sweaters from Sears that we bought when I was twelve -- that is twenty-two entire years ago -- must be made of mithril, because they are still pretty much what they were back then.

text:What does business casual mean to you?	labels:My usual office wear is midi circle skirt and blouse, sheer black tights, pointy flat shoes, cardigan or blazer.  Or a midi or knee length dress, cardigan or blazer.  In some offices I've worked in, solid coloured jeans with no rips count as business casual.  I would wear them with solid coloured tshirts or knitwear and boots or shoes but not sports shoes.	episode_done:True

text:How do I know I‚Äôm not being scammed?	labels:Chances are, if you find the boutique selling the same things as everyone else is on Instagram, it‚Äôs dropshipped. You‚Äôll have to look at reviewers (not anyone paid) to really know. I watch a bunch of Youtube videos and if not available, check reviewing sites.	episode_done:True
text:How do you find your true style when you're surrounded by fast fashion?	labels:Figure out what style the clothes you don't wear are, separate them into season based styles then figure out what the opposite would be.     I love my alternate post-modern goth-punk vibe with a sporty twist, think Pinks early music career with less pop-punk and more punk-rock.	episode_done:True

text:Grad/Masters Fashion Program Reality?	labels:If your goal is to start your own brand or become a fashion designer, or work in the fashion industry on the design and creative side, a marketing degree is an order of magnitude more valuable than a fashion design degree (granted, it should ideally be from a fashion school or a highly respected school). Everyone and their born-rich roommate in NYC has a fashion design degree just because they're interested in fashion and didn't know what to study in uni. In these industries with oversupply of graduates (who are willing to work for less than you), your goal should be to be significantly more valuable than your competitors. Having a marketing double major is one way, though it's also not very uncommon and you will still have significant competition.
text:My goal is genuinely just get enough knowledge to work in clothing design. I have a pretty solid brand made thst ive been working on.  But a brand isnt my ‚Äúgoal‚Äù it‚Äôs more to get enough knowledge and experience to work in clothing and then maybe down the road do that.	labels:You don't need to go to FIT to work in clothing design. But the kind of company you want to work for will determine what kind of school you want to go into. Not because that school necessarily produces better graduates, but because school name and personal connections matter more than skills in that particular industry.   If you want to work for a designer or designer brand, then yes the best way to get there is to get into a reputable fashion school, make connections, and hope for the best. However, if you want to work for fashion brands that are still really good but considered more mid level (especially brands without a "designer" at the helm) then you don't need to go to a high fashion school; you need work experience and a good portfolio.   Your two choices have very different paths to your goal. If you complete your double major, you can begin your career working for smaller brands or larger fashion conglomerates to build your portfolio over a few years. Then, you aim for a well respected mid level brand like an Acne or Our Legacy to establish yourself in the field, and if you're good enough, take a step up to work for a designer.   If you switch schools for fashion design, then you're going to have to try and meet the right people, make the right friends, and produce work that will get people's attention (I cannot stress enough how deeply nepotism runs in these types of industries). If you're lucky (part of the 0.1%), you can graduate with a job at a designer house waiting for you. If you're not lucky, well, you start at a small brand of larger fashion conglomerate with a bigger student loan and fewer meaningful skills. High risk, high reward.   So, it really depends. Do you only want to work for a designer, and nowhere else? Are you willing to spend years building up to your dream job? Do you have a once in a decade talent for fashion design, or do you have grit and determination?
text:Wow, this is such a good answer.   Thank you   I enjoy high end and have a massive knowledge of it. But working immediately in high end isn‚Äôt really my goal. I wanna get a great education, be stimulated , be pushed, I wanna put all my time a nd energy into fashion. It‚Äôs all I think about, all I do, all I want.  My father is ironically a fine artist, that‚Äôs how we live as a family, Off his art. I‚Äôve grown up knowing the work, dedication and talent you have to have even to even make a living off fashion.   It‚Äôs taken me a long time to realize how much I want this, but I‚Äôm 21 and it‚Äôs all I can think about.  If you wanna check some of my work my Instagram is @liepkes. Dm me tell me what you think.	labels:A lot of people live and breathe fashion and say it's all the think about. One of the downsides of an industry that is also a hobby for many, is that there is no shortage of people who desperately want to work in it. That means that: 1.) there is an oversupply of applicants; 2.) it can be a race to the bottom just to get in (unpaid internships, low wages); and 3.) your passion is not enough to get by.   Good luck on your future, and always remember that a job is still a job. And sometimes, it's worse when it's also your hobby.   If your dad is the first result for Liepke then I actually follow him on IG and really admire his art.
text:YES Wow, small world, that is my dad Malcolm Liepke I‚Äôm his son! So wild you know him. Saying I look up to my dad is an understatement. I‚Äôm very lucky to have grown up with such a unique outlook on the arts.  Thank you for the kind words, If I choose the Pratt path I knows it big gamble. I‚Äôll have to live with the decision I make, I‚Äôm leaning towards Pratt but it‚Äôd gonna be hard convincing my parents.	labels:I agree with u/Reactionaire that a marketing degree is extremely valuable. I also agree that fashion is a field with no shortage of talented people. If you want to do actual apparel design, sketching, building concepts, technical design, etc I don‚Äôt see how you‚Äôre getting in the door without a degree unless you have an EXCEPTIONAL portfolio, even at at ‚Äòmid-range‚Äô brand whatever that is. Even FIT grads with exceptional portfolios have a tough time finding a job.   As someone who has worked in fashion in New York for over 20 years and hired for countless entry level positions, take it from me: you have to do the work.
text:Oh yes totally, I definitely need a degree in it. Never Said anything about that. In addition the work has to be put in is definitely massive I understand that.  My question more should I tough it out for 1.5 years at my state university and double major in Marketing/fashion design.  Or  Go to PRATT in nyc and do purely fashion but have to go 3-4 years again.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:DAE feel a disconnect between fashion you see in movies or TV and fashion you see in real life?	labels:There is a disconnect for the general public. I don‚Äôt watch many shows anymore, but I often find in US based shows they look good but I know most people (especially teens?) wouldn‚Äôt always wear high heels, designer dresses and 10 different accessories with a perfect smokey eye and styled hair. Most people get that ain‚Äôt nobody got time (or desire) for that.   Not me though... I mean to be fair in high school I was overdressed and had a reputation for it, but I didn‚Äôt care because I personally loved dressing up and was seen as a stereotypical teen in series lol. I did take inspiration from shows like Sex and the City/Carrie Diaries and Gossip Girl + a few k-dramas or k-pop mv looks. Now I dress more normally, but I get the conception that Europeans are better dressed than Americans which I find funny. I live in Scandinavia though, I feel most people underdress where I live.	episode_done:True
text:What fashion FAQs would you like answered as megathreads? v2	labels:"why do some fits get praised when they clearly go against the sidebar"  "what's the difference between shirt fabrics?"  Edit to distract myself from current events I'm gonna add  "what is the difference between American, italian and British cut suits?"  "where do I go besides MFA to learn more about fashion?"
text:> "why do some fits get praised when they clearly go against the sidebar"  I think this one could be enlightening to a lot of the people who don't understand how avant garde (or even just mildly experimental) inspo posts get so much praise by breaking traditional style conventions. It might help some bridge the knowledge base gap (i.e. you have to know the rules before you can break them) and help explain the (perceived) cognitive dissonance of traditional tailoring *and* designer fashion both being acceptable styles. I think that would help make it seem less jarring to those new readers who get confused when they come to this sub expecting to find answers for "how do I dress so that I look good," but they find a lot more of "how do I dress to express myself?"  For the record I think the second question is a lot more interesting and certainly the reason I'm here, and there's plenty of resources here that answer the first question (*if only people would look for them*), but I do value that this sub does an excellent job of tackling both. More discussion might be beneficial to newcomers to the world of intentional dressing, is all I'm saying, and the ones who are asking questions in-good-faith I think deserve to understand the rationale behind why someone might choose to wear Kapital instead of a suit.  One last edit: Not that I'm saying anyone owes anyone else any explanation for why they dress the way they do, but I think it's always interesting to learn the context.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Transition Lenses/Glasses	labels:I‚Äôve had them on and off since the 90s... (thought they were super cool when I was a kid).. they ARE cool, but the worst part about them is they don‚Äôt stay dark while you‚Äôre driving, so somewhat useless to me. As others have mentioned glasses are pretty cheap nowadays so getting spare shades is the way to go. At the moment my back up pair is transition. Oh and no one will ever notice or care that your glasses are transition, and people don‚Äôt actually have an opinion on them. Also‚Äî when you‚Äôre inside they‚Äôre completely clear like regular glasses.
text:No for sure, you are right it definetly is wroth it I think  It's just for me, it came down to look, if I get transition I had to go 1 size up, so I could have sunglass look, but when it turns white it would look kinda big on me indoors and I didn't want that as I am more indoor than outdoor  If I got my size, then transitions as sunglasses would look small on me outdoor, and would give me this Matrix Morpheus look, plus taking photos - not always do I want shades, I want my eyes to speak  &#x200B;  but yeah if you have big frames already, and mostly plastic, transition would work, but I decided I will either make my old glasses as tinted sunglasses or buy new aviator sunglasses from cheaper online place (just gotta figure out which one is good, I did buy from Firmoo before) - idk what else is good  &#x200B;  but for you - I suggest lookign up at different transition models - there is one xtractive or something that gives more tint when behind the wheel - they got many models for different needs, times and so on	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Does anyone else always hesitate to buy what they truly love because they don't have a social life?	labels:I try to reach a compromise: one of the questions I ask myself before buying something is ‚Äúwill I wear it?‚Äù I‚Äôve learnt that I don‚Äôt really need more dresses, but what does make me feel good is really good quality staples that make day to day clothes stand out more, like a special coat, shoes or earrings. For you, you might want to explore making your jeans, tees and athleisure really good quality so they make you feel good about them when you put them on.  Another way of looking at it is you probably save more money than the average person on going out. You could set aside some money every month for special items of clothing, then try buying and wearing that fancy dress or expensive jeans you mentioned - it‚Äôs much easier to treat yourself on clothes when it‚Äôs designated in your budget. The more you wear them, the more you‚Äôll probably see there are opportunities in your life to show them off.	episode_done:True

text:Wish we could just ban people for this shit  Any conversation around "you have to be attractive/tall/skinny to pull this off", when taken to its logical conclusion, is just people saying that people that don't fit Western beauty standards look objectively bad *at all times* regardless of what they're wearing or doing  Like I've seen people say that if you're short or if you're overweight you can't wear "x", but the "x" is basically everything, and they never seem to reach the point where they admit that they just think that the best certain people can hope for is inoffensive or unnoticeable, which disgusts me	labels:I've talked about this before but a lot of these "rules" that people talk about like "don't wear $thing if you're $characteristic" have to main parts to it:  1.

The window for wearing the basic clothing you've suggested is huge, you're not going to be perceived as cute when you're in your 40s but none of the basic clothing you've suggested is going to make you look like a desperate old man, and your tastes will probably have changed by the time you get there anyway.	episode_done:True

text:1 Year - A Kmn6784 2020 Wardrobe Album	labels:Awesome post, and congrats on understanding your style better.  > I also realized I'm somewhat of a maximist in regards to my wardrobe.  You weren't kidding, but it's great how cheaply you were able to get everything. I'd ask for tips, but I'm seriously considering doing a RONB this year due to spending too much in 2020.	episode_done:True
text:How do your clothes wear out?	labels:- jeans stretch and get droopy butt - shirts and knits get pilling in the fabric - clothes get random holes in them from the dryer or something - sweat stains  The sweat stains are the most annoying. I don‚Äôt really wear jeans anymore. But I sweat a lot as a person. I try to wear undershirts to protect my nicer work clothes but that doesn‚Äôt really work in the summer when it‚Äôs too hot for layers
text:For the sweat stains - machine wash after every wear (don't wear twice) on an appropriate cycle, and use \*bio\* detergent and \*hot\* water.  This should be enough, but if stains do start to appear, use The Laundress Stain Bar (which contains borax) as a pre-wash spot remover. This regime won't work on old stains, but it will work on preventing any new stains.	labels:	episode_done:True

I find it a fun challenge to make them look modern in the way I style them, for example tucked into corduroy palazzo pants that have the same color as the embroided flowers.   I‚Äôm Dutch myself (my partner is Mexican), and traditional clothing here has kinda died out. The only thing I still use are my clogs as quick slip in shoes whenever I‚Äôm going into the garden, very practical haha	episode_done:True

text:The Terribly High Cost of Cheap Goods	labels:Don't believe companies when they say something domestically produced will cost tons more. They lie! It's pure green. Unfettered capitalism. Maximum profit, minimal expense. I've discovered many high quality brands that have their goods made ethically and away from China! They do not cost a lot more and I'm happy to support locally made. No I'm not rich. The problem is that big greedy companies have the marketing budget to promote their cheaply made crap and thus make it hard for smaller independent brands to compete. But we have reddit which has been super useful in discovering such independent brands.
text:Please share the brands! I try to shop as ethically as possible nowadays (which I've found expensive) and thrift before buying new - but I'd also like to support the companies doing it right so that there continues to be an incentive for other companies to move more ethical production.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Covid Dilemna - Finding my style	labels:My mom and I use StitchFix and have liked it so far. If you don‚Äôt end up buying anything, I believe they waive the styling fee and if you do buy something, they use the styling fee as a credit towards what you bought! It‚Äôs nice because you can constantly update what you like and what you don‚Äôt! The app is super user friendly! Some of the clothes are pricey but you can adjust it so that you receive cheaper options!

text:What was your first 'expensive' fashion purchase?	labels:I feel super poor after reading this haha! This year I turned thirty (COVID birthday whoo) and bought my first ever designer purse, a small tote from Kate Spade. I absolutely love it and look forward to using it every day.
text:Love Kate Spade! I actually just bought a frances valentine purse, the line she started before she passed away	labels:Didn't she sell the name/company though before she died?
text:Yes, it was sold to Neiman Marcus and in the end was sold to Tapestry which also owns Coach	labels:	episode_done:True
text:How has your style grown/changed since before quarantine?	labels:More color, dressier, heels every day. The office is the only place I'm around people these days.
text:Work is the only place I go, too. I‚Äôve gotten a little experimental in my work clothes. For example, today I look like what would happen if the staff at Rick Owens got laid off and had to tone it down and work office temp jobs. It‚Äôs definitely edgier than what I‚Äôd usually wear, but definitely not inappropriate. I‚Äôm digging it.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:When is a garment worth it to you?	labels:It‚Äôs like meeting a girl.  When you know, you know.  And like the other guy said I won‚Äôt stop thinking about it after a week and that‚Äôs when I know it‚Äôs worth it.	episode_done:True
text:I‚Äôm moving from California to Michigan. Best way to move my wardrobe?	labels:Wardrobe boxes are great for clothes you want to treat gently. They also make it easy to transfer to your new closet. The downside is that they do not come cheap.
text:Wardrobe boxes are also really strong. Hang clothes on the rack, folded clothes and shoes underneath, stuffables like pillows (and the occasional fragile item) in the space in between. I bet OP could fit the vast majority of that in two XL wardrobe boxes.	labels:I‚Äôd suggest making sure the box is taped well if putting stuff on the bottom.	episode_done:True
text:What's the craziest item you've bought during quarantine?	labels:It‚Äôs not.. an article of clothing? But I bought a sewing machine to make clothes when I don‚Äôt really know how to sew. So that‚Äôs a pretty ridiculous purchase tbh.
text:Start small and work your way up! Maybe sew some pillowcases first to learn making straight/even hems and borders (or I guess you can use scrap cloth but that‚Äôs not as fun or rewarding) - also maybe kitchen cloths - and then maybe you could try tailoring your outfits. Maybe a pants is slightly too long, or a blouse is too loose - now you can hem up the pants and take in the blouse. Don‚Äôt cut cloth until you‚Äôre comfortable!! Sewing is the opposite of cooking - you can subtract but never add, while cooking you can always add but not subtract. And even then, when you build up to the stage where you want to cut cloth, maybe try that project on scrap material first lol. Cloth can be expensive, so as pretty as it is... start small.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Hooded Sweatshirt Roundup	labels:Bizarre exclusion of both Reigning Champ (CYC) and House of Blanks (Roopa Knitting Mills)  The huge portion of the article justifying the purchasing and wearing of a hooded sweatshirt is also one of the more pointless things ever written by this publication.
text:Those hoodies are basic and fit isn‚Äôt even that good	labels:which hoodies? Because those are two very different brands, and nothing about them is any more basic than the hoodies this article talks about.

text:Indoor layers	labels:I have these thoughts almost every Fall. My inspiration Pinterest boards are filled with photos typically taken outside with individuals wearing amazing outerwear. Last year, I bought a camel coat (faux wool, because I couldn‚Äôt invest until I knew if I REALLY liked the look). I loved the look with the coat and I was so sad and torn to remove once indoors. So I guess that‚Äôs the TL;DR, I remove my outerwear indoors. Unless I‚Äôm quickly stopping in somewhere. But it was always a bummer to do because I love the look.  Aside from outerwear, I try to achieve other interesting layers in the form of either mid length structured cardigans, chunky scarves, slightly oversized tunics with tight sleeves (Free People-Esque), and/or bomber jackets that I‚Äôm comfortable leaving on indoors.	episode_done:True

text:Does anyone else have ‚Äúirony pieces‚Äù?	labels:A long time ago, a friend at work told me no one would take me seriously as long as I wore cheapo pantyhose.  I looked down at my crappy nylons and actually felt cheap. I went to Nordtroms that night and bought presentable nylons and wore them to work the next day. She nodded in approvement and then told me no one would take me seriously as long as I wore cheap sweaters. I then bought a wildly pretty ivory cable knit sweater and wore it to work and feeling quite exactly like 1000000 bucks AND i had fancy nylons too. She told me no one would take me seriously with my unkempt shoes and that's when I learned the power of a shoe shining kit.  The next day I wore crappy slacks...and, well you know how the story goes.  To this very day I wear natty clothes and shoes so shiney they can blind fleet of Greek warriors.  The only real irony is no one gave a tootie about nylons and yet I still wear them despite all evidence to the contrary....and she threw al hers away after our company got bought out by another and they were no longer required. (I point at my perfectly appointed knees).
text:I had this coworker. She was Ukrainian and looked amazing every day. Told me I was so pretty but why were my nails bare? Hair not done? Clothes all black? You are a WOMAN, she said.   She always seemed so impressed by each individual change that I kept going. Weekly manicures, nonblack clothing (I discovered that I look great in red!), tasteful makeup. People around the office were gossiping that I was trying to find a man. "No, a man is looking for HER!", she told them.   Then suddenly she disappeared. Quit over the phone and changed her number. I like to think she was an angel in a very impressionable time for me, but I think she might have just had issues with her work visa.	labels:I fanfictioned for myself that she was a fabulous spy a la ‚ÄúThe Americans.‚Äù But while she was here, she made a side quest to hype you up.

If you don‚Äôt want to give money to Bezos, though, that‚Äôs super valid. I‚Äôve bought them in the past from Uniqlo as well.	episode_done:True
text:Women who have revamped your entire wardrobe ‚Äî how did that go? What is your advice for the rest of us?	labels:If you aren't married to the idea of capsules:  Buy seasonally appropriate basics and rent fancier work clothing or special occasion garments from Rent the Runway (or another rental brand). It's a good way to take your time with building a wardrobe you like while trying out trends you may be curious about but hesitant to pull the trigger on. It's worth noting that your wardrobe is never really done. Things get worn out, fall out of favor, stop fitting your lifestyle, or you just stop liking them. I think if you have a solid foundation (jeans, slacks, a few blouses, sweaters, t-shirts, undergarments, a few pairs of black and brown shoes) you can find flexibility with styling beyond that without feeling that you have not enough clothing or a million things and nothing to wear.	episode_done:True

text:What did your mom teach you about fashion/style - and what did she not teach you?	labels:If I picture my mom's typical winter outfit it was a sweater with snakes wearing sombreros and margaritas embroidered on it, a burgundy "sweater jacket" with fringe, and a pink/orange/green bucket purse.*  So I guess she taught me "fuck it, wear what you want", but it did take me a while to adopt that attitude.   *tbf, this was a look for moms in the 90s
text:That sweater sounds amazing.  source: am mom.	labels:I really didn't appreciate her taste enough. One thing I did steal from her were a pair of earrings that are just dangling wooden parrots. I did like her Christmas party uniform, which was a long navy dress, a cream colored military style jacket, and block heeled sling backs.  The 90s really were a trip.
text:I gave my mom a pair of those earrings as a mother's day gift when I was like four. My dad let me pick them myself. My mom is really into "tasteful" things, so I don't think she's ever worn them.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE!- November 04	labels:Is it obsessive to get a jacket in another color?  I got this simple jacket from costco last year 20 bucks in a emerald green and it goes well with some of my outfits and eye color tbh.  This year the green was olvie but had a darker portion on the sleeves which looked sleek so i got it too.  I dont really need another jacket but is 20 bucks and i generally dont get everything in every color.  I guess I feel a bit guilty, cause i do have a lot of clothes but i have a closet that isn't even entirely filled so...  i feel like a few things it's okay as long as it isn't everything?  the greens are diff imo, quite diff but def both "green".
text:i think it's good not to have redundancy (i only try to ever have one pair of black combat boots, one ____-color leather jacket, one pair of olive pants, etc) especially if your closet is incomplete but if it's that cheap i would say it is not that big a deal	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Just how revolutionary is Harry Styles‚Äô Vogue cover?	labels:Women look better in dresses.  You can be as progressive and woke as you want, and encourage whatever you want so people can express themselves, but aesthetics dont care about that stuff. Womens clothing is typically styled to cater to the female (sex) body. People always comment on the dress itself, or whether it works, but never how that same outfit would just look better on a female.  This is a matter of aesthetic and taste to some extent, and thinking that men generally look bad in dresses is a justified opinion.
text:This seems like an incomplete comment to me for a couple of reasons.  First, the argument that women look better in dresses isn't particularly useful, because that same reasoning could be applied to everyone, but just in this way; 'a more attractive person would look better in this' the comment doesn't isn't actually talking about this person in this piece of clothing.  Second, I think a big flaw around this is that women tend to look better in dresses because women have had thousands of years of aesthetic development to make dresses look good on them. I think that this dress itself conveys that quite well, the collar of this dress looks out of place to me and I think that is because the dress is held back by that idea that a dress is for women, and the design language and cut's haven't developed around men so much.  In particular, the style of ball gowns in particular which this dress effectively is, fall into that much harder than another type of dress might, more casual shirt-dresses that button down the front that can repurpose some of the aesthetic of mens shirts etc and would make the transition over to being worn by men with less of this friction.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Tailoring as a lifestyle choice - Suiting in The Crown	labels:In the age of WFH, what if men just started really living in their tailoring? Hands thrust in pockets, lounging on a picnic blanket, feet up binging Netflix?  An interesting thought exists that as mens casual wear became more acceptable that suiting became more structured and stiff. Thoughts?
text:I love the idea of this, although really good custom tailoring as they describe in the article is not exactly easy to come by. I think you are right about suiting; nowadays it seems exclusively reserved for weddings, special events, etc. and is rarely intended for every day wear.   Still, I almost always get dressed up to some extent when I‚Äôm WFH. I can‚Äôt bear to sit around in sweatpants and an old tee all day like a lot of people seem to do. Look good, feel good!	labels:Obviously the level of tailoring available to the Royal Family and their personal means, makes wearing suits more practical for them than most people. Of course what's interesting about HRH Prince Charles is that he WEARS his suits, meaning that they are repaired and adjusted and stay with him for decades...it's a very Trad approach to clothing.	episode_done:True

text:How do you shop for specific things without google clogging up with items from fast fashion? Or.

Fast fashion definitely makes it way in there but you can raise your price bar to around $10+ or $15+ to weed all those out.

text:Any experiences with Wonder Wardrobe or other online courses?	labels:I have followed the WW course ! It's nice but it still leaves you with a lot of questions. My wardrobe hasn't really changed. I think you need to be very much involved and focused and I don't really have the time and money for that.  I also feel like it gave me even more 'rules' to follow and now I have less fun than before with my clothes.  Capsule wardrobe is not for me, I don't own many clothes but seeing the same 8 tops every day is depressing to me.
text:Oh! That's interesting, I feel less sure about taking the course after reading comments.  Did you feel that her style personality categories were too rigid? Another comment mentioned that she apparently uses "five fashion personalities".  If you watched her YouTube channel, would you say her course goes a lot deeper than it, or can you basically get the idea from watching her YouTube?	labels:Hi, sorry for super late reply!  I didn't really felt like the fashion personnalities were too rigid, but she uses seasons to describe different kind of people and what color scheme looks good on them.  While it's not super rigid and she does mention it's just an advice, I ended up not wanting to wear some clothes I loved just because of it. I'm also not sure I agree with the classification. For exemple, I think I'm supposed to be a Winter type (cold, bright colors), but I find that a dark orange looks ok on me. Maybe I got my type wrong though !  I think it gets more in-depth than her YouTube videos, but the fashion advice she gives can all be found somewhere else online. It's just handier and she is very clear in her explanations, which is nice. There is also a very helpful community.  I hope this helps :)	episode_done:True

text:If you could get yourself one fashion gift, what would it be?	labels:I'd get a really nice piece of outerwear, either a coat in a quality material like wool or a leather or shearling jacket. If you live somewhere with colder weather during part of the year, outerwear is something you'll be wearing all the time so it's worth investing in a piece that's great quality, keeps you warm and makes a statement. I think an amazing jacket or coat will elevate even the most basic outfit, whether it's a more classic piece, something utilitarian like a puffer jacket or something more extravagant. Personally I think Acne, Chloe and Tibi are brands that make great high-end outerwear in a variety of styles.

text:how often do you wash your clothes?	labels:I wash underwear, socks, masks, leggings, and tank tops (I wear one under most outfits for smoothness/sweat!) after each wear. Outer layers like sweaters, hoodies, etc after three or four wears. Jeans after four or more wears‚Äî can usually tell by how they feel and fit that they‚Äôre ready for a wash.  Bralettes when they start to smell!
text:How do you separate your laundry? I‚Äôve been separating it by ‚Äútype‚Äù but everyone I know does it by color. Now I‚Äôm starting to wonder if I‚Äôm doing something wrong, but washing black underwear with black jeans just bc theyre the same color sounds so odd to me	labels:I personally wash everything together if I know that the colors won‚Äôt bleed. So if you have not washed something in a darker color before, absolutely wash it by itself before tossing it in with whites! If the underwear is delicate, a delicates or lingerie bag is a good (reasonably inexpensive) investment, though I‚Äôd still be wary of tossing them in with anything denim or generally rough (t-shirts or blouses are fine). When I was living with the rest of my family, we separated out by ‚Äúhot water‚Äù (socks, underwear, etc) and ‚Äúcold water‚Äù (everything else) more than color.	episode_done:True

text:NYT: Jil Sander is back, with a new Uniqlo collaboration and a lot of opinions.	labels:Here in Denmark a lot of stuff was sold out two hours after launch online. Went to the store though, and they had everything. I was in love with the oversized parka from pictures but once I actually tried it on, I got a bit disappointed with it. It was too long IMO and overall had that same slightly childish/adolescent look that I also think the original Uniqlo hybrid parka has. I think pairing the oversized silhouette with a slightly cropped length could have made all the difference and made it s sweet piece. But it honestly is not that different from the original. The turtleneck however is awesome. It's way wider than uniqlos usual sweaters so it fits amazing. Uniqlos standard turtleneck is stupid slim	episode_done:True

We're under strict lockdown again in my area, so I'm sure there will be even more stores gone once malls open again.

text:Is the high fashion industry a little tone-deaf for F/W 2020?	labels:Why would it be tonedeaf? This is kind of a U.S.-centric view. Not everyone in the world is still struggling with COVID, and a lot of the rest of the world isn't nearly as casual as America is, fashion-wise.   Call me crazy, but I'm tired of shapeless billowy clothing in earth tones, and I am READY for some structure and interesting textures. All summer has been about beige and washed out green and brown linen, let's see something else.   Plus, it's a weird take anyway, because high fashion doesn't really target loungewear, either way. Do we really expect major fashion houses to all abandon blazers and leather pants and start showing PJs and sweatpants on the runway?   Others have already pointed out that these collections have been designed months in advance, but consider another point - fashion has always been reactive. When forced to stay inside and only wear sweatpants for 6 months, people will rebel and start daydreaming and longing for the opposite. This pandemic was always going to inspire a sort of glam rock aesthetic, imo. BRING IT.

text:Advice needed - Nordstroms Out of Stock items	labels:Have you called a store near you? With Nordstrom specifically, your best bet is to get ahold of a sales rep and pray that they'll want to help you. They can do a stock search and see if there are any units left in the company (aka did someone return it?) that can be shipped from the store to you. You'd probably have to call periodically to check.  If it's something super hype, like the latest Supreme shirt, you're SOL and would have better luck buying it after-market at a higher price than retail.  Calling and having someone ship something to you from a store doesn't work for every company - Sephora won't do it and I don't think most fast fashion places will either. Your chances of getting a sold out item go up if you have an established relationship with a sales associate.
text:I used to agree with this but Nordstrom has changed their algorithms and their site/app has much higher stock accuracy than it used to. And I can promise if it‚Äôs a final item in the company, the stock team is 99x more likely to locate it than a sales associate. The stock team needs to find a manager to sign off on a rejected order while a sales person answering the phone just needs to act like they checked (spoiler: they usually don‚Äôt).   Just check the app often, maybe multiple times a day, and place the order the second you see it.   Edit for clarity	labels:Used to work there and this isn‚Äôt true. Employees in store can check where items are and request other stores to ship it. They‚Äôll typically try hard to do this too because they get commission off of it. There is the chance that the item can be denied if it‚Äôs only 1 in stock at another store, but they have a quota on denying items too, so they don‚Äôt want to do that often.   Try going into a store to see if they can find another store to ship it directly to you.
text:Me too. I worked for Nordstrom for almost ten years, mostly as a DM but also in HR, and quit last winter when my role moved into more of a fulfillment focus. Managers have to do ‚Äúblitzes‚Äù to clear DTC screens and if web-team cannot find an item, they will come find a DM or ADM to do a last check and sign off on the reject.   Therefor, when you have a web order for a last in company, a manager will have a hand in trying to find the item where as a salesperson calling another store is likely to reach another salesperson, who may or may not have any interest in searching for the item. As you know, only the salesperson placing the order gets commission ‚Äî not the salesperson on the other end looking for the item. Plus, if it‚Äôs a recent return, it might be in inventory but not back to its home department; in that case web will have much better chances of finding it.  Now that last in company items will show up on the app/website (they used to only show up in store on merch search) I see no reason to call the store to bother people with locating your items. The salespeople honestly hate finding DTCs, and they‚Äôve started to restrict the sort of credit information salespeople can take over the phone. In Los Angeles, you can‚Äôt pay over the phone for designer items any more unless your card is already on file with a store associate.  This is all new as of about 2 years ago, and piloted in the Los Angeles stores so depending on where you worked and how long ago, this may sound new, but I can promise you this is how it‚Äôs being done currently.  Edit: also going to clarify the ‚Äúquota‚Äù on denying items. The store‚Äôs fulfillment rate (which they usually refer to in terms of inventory accuracy) has to be above something like 88% to allow in-store pickup and same day services; but when you are calling a salesperson for a Manual DTC before placing, the order is not yet on their screen and doesn‚Äôt count for or against their inventory accuracy.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Hiking Aesthetic - Functionality vs. Fashion	labels:I wear my yoga clothes with hiking boots and a Patagonia fleece in the summer and fall, Patagonia Radalie jacket in the winter. My friend has a UV protection shirt (REI house brand) which she wears due to the intense UV rays in Colorado. It doesn‚Äôt make her feel hot most days. I mostly thrift my yoga/hiking clothes, and really like thrifted Lululemon. Although I hike and do yoga frequently, I won‚Äôt buy Lululemon full price when there are so many used gear stores near me. I buy Zella leggings also for both activities. My hiking boots are currently Oboz, my trail running shoes are Asics, and I have heard good things about Salomon hiking boots. Fjallraven has very nice beanies for colder weather.  I definitely say fashion takes a backseat to function for hiking, as you primarily want to be comfortable, however, living in the mountain west, I want to look nice during an activity I do about once weekly, so fashion is at least a consideration for me.  (Edit) You can absolutely hike in your everyday clothing, and I have seen people hike 14,000 foot mountains in gym shorts and a T shirt. As long as your boots and socks are solid and the rest is easy to move in, you‚Äôre honestly good to go.
text:I love Salomon for Hiking boots, trail runners, ski boots, literally everything. I also love the Adv Skin 5 Hydration Pack :)   I've started wearing trail runners for day hikes and I like how much lighter they are as well as how quickly they dry (not having to take them off for stream crossings is huge). Granted I don't have any issues with ankle mobility and I consider myself to be pretty coordinated where I don't need hiking boots to help with stability if I'm not doing a longer trip.  The point about thrifted Lululemon is solid as well. I have leggings that have held up for 10 years now, and I recently bought a pair of yoga shorts from the brand and they're pilling like crazy, while the old ones I have look newer than the new pair.	labels:	episode_done:True

The main difference is cuffed/cropping in the pants, but even then there's a lot of people, especially girls, wearing baggy low-rise cargo pants that go full break at their big chunky sneakers.	labels:i see where it comes from, cause for the past few years cuffing pants and having a more looser fit became alot more popular, this just seems like a normal transition from that to a more oversized/cuffed look from the tapered look thats kinda falling out tbh.   like its something i see alot of people who cuff their pants above the shoe moving to. like me honestly and i see it being a thing in the future i just cant see myself doing it.	episode_done:True

text:Inspo Album: Vintage Wool Sweaters Need Good, Loving Homes	labels:Awesome that they are still around. A testament to the durability and quality of real wool. I‚Äôm 75, so this kind of sweater was all we had to stay warm in the winter when we were young. I knitted quite a few as well. When Polar Fleece became available the woolies were less used. However I still appreciate the warmth of a real 100% cashmere or the feel of an Icelandic cardigan knitted in the natural colors . As a knitter I love to see the hard work in a wool garment and the lovely colors that you can find in the older handmade sweaters. They need some care(laundering by hand and blocking to keep their shape, air drying) store away from bugs in the off season ( mothballs!) and kept folded on a shelf or in a drawer not on hangers when in active use. You‚Äôll also find wonderful interesting buttons on the vintage (yikes that‚Äôs my childhood years!) items. Lovely sweaters that deserve to be enjoyed by a new generation ‚ù§Ô∏è Buying vintage? Look for stains, moth holes, odd shape from improper laundering, missing buttons. These are major faults.
text:I have an extensive collection of (mostly-thrifted) cashmere and wool (seriously, it's a problem and I'm trying to get rid of part of it before I move). Although I have never had moths, I'm paranoid about them. I use a vodka/filtered water/lavender/cedar/mint/other herbs essential oil spray instead of mothballs, because I hate the smell of the chemicals. (I actually just bought a secondhand vintage cashmere sweater that absolutely reeked if mothballs, and I had to wash it, soak it in vinegar, air it out outside, and spray with the vodka solution to deodorize it). Does anybody else have experience with this? I don‚Äôt actually know if the spray actually works to repel moths, but I wash all my sweaters in lavender baby shampoo before storing them, so that may also help since moths are attracted to human odors/food stains.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:I dyed my leather boots and here is how it went.	labels:I have dyed a leatherwallet from Fossil before! Left the leather wallet in a soaked shopping bag and forgot about it. By the time I finally took it out , the soft brown leather had a big wet stains all over it which could not be fixed. I couldn‚Äôt bring myself to throw it away because it‚Äôs a gift from my mom, so I decided to dye it black. It‚Äôs been 2 years since the dye job, and the dye has held up really well (might upload the current pic if enough people are interested). I‚Äôve also helped friends refresh their leather wallets/accessories/furniture using black leather dye, all with good results.  Every time I see people saying that their dye job has chipped/faded (I remember a few youtubers trying to dye their beige Chanel bagsblack), it‚Äôs likely because one of the following three reasons:   1) the new dye was not treated with a sealant.  2) the coating/sealant from original piece was not completely stripped, or had oils/waxes (from hand/leather care products) remaining on the surface preventing the dye from sticking. 3) the material is not leather, but polyurethane.  Applying sealant is absolutely crucial for longevity IMO. r/leathercraft has helped me so much!  Beautiful work OP!	episode_done:True

I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd buy one from another company unless it was at the same level of environmentally friendly as a Patagonia one. Thank you for the recommendations though!
text:I mean, if it's used does environmental production really matter anymore?	labels:I mean when it comes to washing it! Fleece sheds a bunch of tiny fibers when you wash it.
text:Ah, I'm aware of that but I didn't know that Patagonia's fleece was better at not shedding.

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - November 29, 2020	labels:I recently got an Alpha M65 (the older model, not the Heritage) after a long and drawn out exchange process due to just HOW drastically oversized they are, and while it fits well and is comfortable, warm, etc. it's still pretty stiff despite constantly being worn. I'm guessing because my job, while outdoors half the time, is not particularly labor-intensive.   I'm just wondering if there's any method of kind of breaking it in, so to speak. Should I wash it (as per the instructions on the inner tag), maybe? I'm worried that might prematurely fade it, or worse, cause it to shrink the way hoodies sometimes can even if you wash on cold and air dry.	episode_done:True
text:Difficulty distinguishing between so 'idealized' style and personal style?	labels:Right now, a lot of people's best intentions are devolving into "old lounge wear" because we haven't anywhere to go. Or when we have, it's running errands. Australia just got out of lockdown, I know Germany is going back in partially, the UK's going back in... and America is still a chaotic mess, but a lot of people are still working from home. So part of the answer may be "wait unti the world is different for you".

After years of experimenting, I‚Äôve finally landed on a style that feels right to me and have a curated closet full of beautiful things I love, but I‚Äôm not wearing any of that right now.

text:Experience with fast fashion brands for office casual clothes (Shein, Fashion Nova, etc)?	labels:I think you would be best off buying from reputable brands during their sales. Their returns process will be better typically too. A $20 blouse on sale from J Crew Outlet is usually going to be better than a $20 blouse from Fashion Nova. A lot of these sites have customer service issues as well.  I have purchased from ROMWE (basically SHEIN they are the same company) and depending on the material you may be able to score some things decent enough for Zoom meetings, but not good enough that you will want to wear outside of a webcam.	episode_done:True
text:How many distinctly different outfits do you have?	labels:I've wondered about the same thing a lot before. I spent some time working in Japan, and I had a fairly limited professional wardrobe there. I had a handful of skirts, with only two silhouettes really - a long maxi and a full a-line knee-length. To add to that, two pairs were literally the same skirt, just in two different colors. So I had to plan how I wore them pretty carefully to try not to repeat them more than once a week, and to try to avoid a weekly schedule of skirt wearing. What I really relied on was my blouses and sweaters, because although their silhouette and fit was also very similar to one another, they tended to have patterns and be more distinguishable that way.  To be honest though, I think I spent a lot of time worrying over something that few people really paid much attention to. There were a few times I forgot to do laundry and ran out of clothes, so I had to repeat an outfit before I wanted, and no one ever commented or gave me weird looks. And I definitely knew people who just repeated things all the time and didn't care. I think if anything, if many of your clothes are very similar, it makes it easier to dress and just becomes a distinctive style trait.	episode_done:True

Which singed item is now your favourite? Which molten accessory will you pair with your outfit?   \- Your new crush is only turned on by food. Which delicious, home cooked/prepped/baked outfit will you wear to seduce them? How does your outfit represent their food choices (chocolate addict, vegan, lactose intolerant)?   \- You are visiting your mother for a few days, but somehow your clothes got lost. Which items from her wardrobe will you wear? Do you end up looking like your mom or are you able to wear something that represents your own style? Bonus question: how would your mom like if the situation was reversed?   \- You get a last minute invitation to a party. The dresscode says only 'Christmas'. Alas, you do not own anything Christmas themed. What outfit can you come up with (using only non-Christmas themed items) that is still Christmas-y? Beginner level: it is winter. Expert level: it is summer.  \- Your friend(s)/colleague/whatever asks you to help them find an outfit. You thought they would never ask! This is your chance. What outfit do you think they would look great in? How different is it from their regular outfits? Why have they never thought of this themselves?   \- Society as we know it has changed. Nowadays, everyone on Earth wears the same, neutral outfit. The only way you can express your individuality is through your shoes. Which ones do you wear to represent your style, interests or personality? Which (hidden) message do they convey?

I hope you enjoy it ‚ù§Ô∏è  P.S. just a note that the size twin app is going to be updated in the next week or so -- it's very out of date. If you follow me on IG that's the easiest way to hear about updates, but I can edit this comment when it's refreshed, too!   **(11/30 update if anybody is still reading -- the app is updated!)**  Edit: since so many of you are finding the tool mostly useless, I just wanted to say that the goal was to create something that would help you find fashion inspo from people who are more similar in size to you than a fashion model in a magazine.  Of course it's impossible to get an exact body double from just 3 measurements, but that's what the standard is, and that's what I could reasonably expect the average person to know about themselves. I have to make sure that the barrier to entry is very low. The more people can join this index, the more useful it is. Please remember that I offer this tool completely for free, that I don't work in the fashion industry, and that I don't have any background in the industry (fashion, data, or web design). I just wanted to do something helpful for the community. I will try my best to make as many improvements as I can over time, but I have very limited resources, and maintaining it is quite a lot of effort as is. Sorry, all!

text:Are Luxury Fashion Brands Becoming Like Fast Fashion?	labels:Hm, I wonder if the same thing is happening there as has happened to so many other business sectors since the start of the MBA boom.   * Company has a fine, high quality product  * Consumers buy it on reputation * MBA comes in, cuts costs and quality * Consumers continue to buy assuming quality is the same * Profit margins up massively, MBA takes the opportunity to leave on a high note * Consumers finally realize it's garbage and stop buying * MBA already gutting the next brand  It's been happening everywhere the last few decades.
text:I think actually the issue is they went from being family owned private businesses to parts of conglomerates who are publicly traded. Growth is king. So they need to sell a lot more product or be more expensive or both to increase revenue and profits.  Luxury has become trend driven and decreasingly focused on craftsmanship to keep up with the quarterly numbers and growth targets.   Handbags, makeup, sunglasses, and perfume are very profitable and open the door to lower end customers.   The street wear trend is a boon because manufacturing and materials costs are very cheap, design needs are minimal, and it sells for a huge markup.	labels:> to parts of conglomerates who are publicly traded  That's usually how those pesky MBAs get in there, via merger or acquisition.	episode_done:True

text:How have you changed your style and/or shopping habits after your body has changed?	labels:I went through this too, and while going through it, did an entire wardrobe overhaul. Instead of lamenting the weight gain, I chose to have a ton of fun buying new clothes for my bigger pandemic size. I‚Äôve had a great time eating really enjoyable food during quarantine, I don‚Äôt care that I‚Äôm fat now. Also, I had been ready to re-do my style for a while, and this seemed like the perfect time.   However, now knowing how easy it is to fluctuate in size, I used weight fluctuation as a deciding factor in what I chose to buy: I only purchased items that will fit with a fluctuation anywhere from 5-15lbs (I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2). Seems crazy, but it actually is possible. I stuck to either loose silhouettes, or tight yet forgiving stretchy styles.   What worked for me in choosing what I invested in was just ensuring I put enough time and effort into the process. I downloaded Pinterest and spent an inordinate amount of time looking at street clothes, I set a budget, thought about what items I needed, and did a ton of online window shopping. Once I had a better idea of what I wanted my new style to be, I did a lot of online shopping. I did return a lot of things, but also kept a lot, too.   Think about items of clothing that you gravitate towards, that make you feel really good. Use that to form the basis of your wardrobe. The process does take time and effort, but doing enough prep before buying will really make the process way easier.

text:Dashiel Brahmann Fall/Winter 2020	labels:This is really cool stuff. To me this seems like a much more accessible version of a lot of Rick Owens‚Äô looks- how to not look like you‚Äôre wearing a costume.
text:Hot take everything is a costume.   Most people wear pants designed for mining (jeans) with shoes designed to be used for athletic purposes (sneakers) with a top designed to be underwear (t-shirt) the only reason this doesn't look odd to us is because of slow societal acceptance and popular people in our society helping speed this up (James Dean wearing teeshirts and jeans Thom Brown bringing the slim fit suit back).	labels:I feel like we‚Äôre talking about two different things. I don‚Äôt see anything wrong with distinguishing between more day to day wearable pieces and much more outwardly avant-gard looks, even if they‚Äôre from a designer such as Rick who is acclaimed and popular to people who have familiarity with high fashion.  If I understand you correctly you‚Äôre talking about how functional items have become fashionable or are used beyond their original purpose (like jeans or like a leather biker off of a motorcycle) but that isn‚Äôt really what Rick is? He‚Äôs not starting from a functional utilitarian perspective. I only meant that this looks like it straddles the line better between more ‚Äúnormal‚Äù casual looks and full ‚Äúhigh fashion‚Äù looks in an interesting way.
text:My whole point was that calling something costumey is a poor/negative description of avant-garde/high fashion, because at it's essence your saying that those people aren't dressing true to themselves (they are wearing a costume) and your not describing anything about the piece.  I agree with you though it definitely hits a nice middle ground between totally high-fashion and more traditional clothes.	labels:Oh I see what you‚Äôre saying now, thanks for explaining. I certainly don‚Äôt mean this in a negative way to describe how someone chooses to express themselves at all, and certainly don‚Äôt mean to say dressing avant-garde is inauthentic. At the same time, I don‚Äôt think those things are mutually exclusive. This sub is full of people half-joking or joking about capes and cloaks, and every so often someone asks about a long duster or the like from Blade Runner or the Matrix or something. You could still be dressing true to yourself and look a bit out of place.  I don‚Äôt think people advising someone to not dress like a movie character are impugning how that person wishes to express themselves as inauthentic. Rather, the perception of the layperson of some person dressed as Neo would be ‚Äúcostumey‚Äù I think the same could be said for someone in full Rick- it doesn‚Äôt change the layperson perception just because one of those two people choosing to dress outside the norm knows more about fashion than the other.	episode_done:True
text:How do you know if a piece of clothing is worth its price?	labels:Other than figuring out the cost per use I tend to make a list of items I actually need/want and then try to only buy things from that list regardless of the sale.

text:Let's Talk about hats	labels:There is hat etiquette from the days of yore. Here are some of the conventions that were adhered to:  A lady does not remove her hat when indoors or for the national anthem. This is in contrast to men, who are to remove hats when indoors and for the anthem. However, if you‚Äòre sporting a baseball cap at a ballgame, I would remove it for the anthem, whereas if you were wearing a more formal outfit with hat then I would not remove it.  A hat is a daytime piece in most cases not suitable for evening wear. The fascinator is an exception to this rule, but is more of a Commonwealth/British thing.  A lady does not wear a hat in her own home, ie when receiving guests, and as a guest in a friend‚Äôs home a lady would remove her hat.

If you really want to do this and are comfortable with it then by all means go ahead. But from my own experience I did this, and actually did it fairly well after many years, but at the end of the day it stood out too much in real everyday life in a normal town, regardless of how nice the outfit was, and it definitely hurt my social reputation a lot. After toning it down a bit I immediately noticed a difference in how much more positively I was treated by people. You can still dress well, but remember context is key.

I regret nothing! If you have the disposable income to pay up front and wait for the refund to be processed, I highly suggest getting all your options so you aren't left wondering if you really have the right size or ordering another pair to try on.    Edit: as /u/fartymcfly22 pointed out, you might want to check that the company doesn't just throw away their returns before ordering duplicates like this!

Prime Wardrobe has helped me with finding sizing so much!	episode_done:True
text:Do you have a concept of "Par Value" in menswear?	labels:From a logical perspective, it makes a lot of sense and this system would work for most people. I think everyone naturally has a different idea of what "on par" means to them given their budget and taste and there's a saying that the value of a piece is what the buyer is willing to pay for it. Sometimes there will be those pieces that just speak to you regardless of the price and while those are a rarity, I would like to see that incorporated into this system. This is more true when you start going up the scale where fashion becomes more of an art form instead of "clothes". For me, I would pay $1000 for a Craig Green jacket because I love his work and it speaks to me on a deeper level like a '97 Honda NSX would; to me the experience is worth the money. While the numbers are important, to match your golf analogy, it's still a game to have fun.
text:Absolutely. But I also find it helpful in those contexts with beautiful pieces. So, if I tell myself, yeah, $400 for a piece of outerwear with features a, b, c is fair, but this $600 piece really speaks to me, I might go for it, but if it's $1800, fuck that, I could probably just get it made, or get something else that speaks to me just as much for cheaper.	labels:	episode_done:True

Some companies like H&M saw the writing on the wall and has a made pivot to 'sustainability' marketing in their products and have since been successful.    Now I see the word 'sustainable' tossed everywhere, Instagram, TikTok, in higher volume, the marketing has changed but the culture hasn't.

The idea that you become and adult and you must ditch trends is an internet myth, if you look at actual people (adults) that have some interest in style/fashion - they are following trends.  Maybe not in the same way or timeline as teenagers but they are not just wearing white buttons and trench coats all the time.  And even if they were, white button downs and trench coats are not exactly the same now as they were ten or twenty or thirty years ago.	episode_done:True

text:Ordered from Shoe The Bear (rant, experience in post)	labels: On Cyber Monday 2018, I bought a pair of Suede Chelsea boots from Shoe The Bear and they're one of my favorite pairs of kicks. Fit was awesome, quality was amazing for what I paid (~$70). I've worn these boots 100+ time and still holding up great.  Fast forward to this past Cyber Monday. I wanted a pair of cognac/brown colored Chelseas from Shoe The Bear. They arrived within a few days fron Portugal. I was so excited to open the box....and they are completely the wrong color.  They're so far from the correct color, customer service is claiming that I treated the leather myself and they don't carry boots in this color.  To say this experience is bizarre is an understatement - No, I did not treat the leather. I took the picture within minutes of opening the package because I couldn't believe what I received. I'm going to try and return them but now they're claiming I treated the leather so who knows what will happen.
text:That CS pushback is 100% a sign of Shoe the Bear knowing full well they got the color wrong on this entire product, as a company is refusing to acknowledge the error on their part and given guidance to CS to dispute the complaints.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:How do I know I‚Äôm not being scammed?	labels:Find actual boutiques in your town/nearby cities etc. Either use Google maps, try posting on reddit/facebook pages from those nearby towns or cities.  Then check if they have a website. I would expect the contact details to have their actual street address (verifiable on google maps and street view, or a drive past), contact details (call them up and ask some questions) and their refund policies etc.    Most of the actual boutiques I know of - their photos (Instagram especially) are all taken in store, in front of the store, or nearby. They typically use the staff working there or regular customers as models - you tend to see the same faces.	episode_done:True
text:What rockstar(s) you take fashion inspiration from? What do you like about their style?	labels:Gwen Stefani has always been my biggest inspiration. I was 4 when Tragic Kingdom came out and MTV was always on in my house back in those days so seeing her was like seeing a real life cartoon character. No one in my town looked like that. I was instantly obsessed. I can trace my love of leopard print directly back to her outfit in the Sunday Morning music video.	episode_done:True

text:Teach me how to successfully shop secondhand please!! Or just commiserate if it‚Äôs hard for you too lol.	labels:Most of my secondhand finds are from online auctions or poshmark-type sites. I‚Äôd say about half my wardrobe is from these places (more like 80% for shoes).  - Have a pattern. Search for the same items/brands/keywords over time and get a good idea of what‚Äôs available and what a fair price is.   - Buy fabrics, brands and cuts you already know and like. I‚Äôve made some big mistakes with things like second hand cashmere because I don‚Äôt normally wear it and I didn‚Äôt know what to look for.   - Be picky. There‚Äôs so much choice that it becomes overwhelming, so you‚Äôve got to have a firm idea of what your dislikes are. No matter how cute the garment is, I won‚Äôt buy certain things... for example, visible distressing, suede footwear and polka dot are all off the table because I just won‚Äôt wear them.   You‚Äôve got to be willing to take the hits with the misses when you‚Äôre doing this online - I‚Äôd say my success rate is around 50/50 for things that make it into my regular wardrobe rotation. I do my best to resell my fails, and I‚Äôd say I probably break even on average, but it‚Äôs a lot of effort and not for the faint hearted. But I love doing it so it‚Äôs more like a hobby than a chore - but it‚Äôs not for everyone, and there‚Äôs no shame in that!	episode_done:True
text:The joy of cordovan‚Äîand how to wear and maintain it	labels:Cordovan is an Instagram dream - it‚Äôs lustrous and has a ton of color depth. Unfortunately I find  actually wearing it is a different story. It‚Äôs extremely stiff and inflexible, especially during the first 20-30 wears. It‚Äôs the coldest leather I‚Äôve ever worn (like my feet are freezing even with medium wool socks). On the flip side, they are super warm in anything over 75 degrees so I avoid them in summer. Spotting in the rain is incredibly annoying so I‚Äôve just avoided wearing them in high temps, whereas my calf boots are completely fine in summer. Also, they are on dainite soles which are terrible in winter snow or slush.   I‚Äôm glad I own a pair of color 8 Alden 986, and my Viberg bourbon shell service boots. They are great for certain occasions. But in sum, I have a pair of ~$1300 boots that I generally can wear between 40-75 degrees Fahrenheit when there‚Äôs no precipitation or inclement weather. Keep that in mind before you jump into the shell world.
text:Spotting is certainly a common complaint and I can see how it diminishes people‚Äôs enjoyment of shell boots. I live in a place with 250 days with rain per year and wear mine in all weather conditions (except old snow as I‚Äôm afraid of the salts). I have some semi-permanent spots on faded ravello, but have accepted them as part of the patina. My color 8, black and cigar shoes all deal really well with rain and mud and I find them much easier to clean than calf skin/cow hide boots. Now that I think of it, maybe there‚Äôs so much rain here that they now have ‚Äôeven‚Äò stains. Shell shoes can be enjoyed as heavy beaters, I believe.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:What‚Äôs your favorite winter fashion staple?	labels:I‚Äôm from Minnesota and I can relate to the winter fashion struggle lol. I‚Äôm a huge bargain hunter because I‚Äôm on that college student budget but I find winter outerwear to be one area where you mostly get what you pay for, although there are deals to be had. Layers are your best friend.  A pair of straight leg or mom jeans will probably leave you enough space to wear a pair of fleece lined leggings underneath to keep you toasty. Wool or cashmere sweaters in tight knits as opposed to more open weaves, with a tight long sleeve tshirt or long underwear shirt underneath. Riding boots with enough calf space to wear long wool socks underneath if you prefer skinny jeans/pants or dresses/skirts. I thrift a lot of this stuff or buy it at outlet stores (Nordstrom Rack, Marshall‚Äôs, etc).  A high-quality wool coat in a neutral color is definitely a worthwhile investment if you don‚Äôt like the look of down parkas. I got mine from a local outlet for $80 (90% off!) and it stands up really well to cold weather. I have a really good sized collection of winter accessories (hats, gloves, etc.) and I buy some cheap stuff in trendy colors/styles from Marshall‚Äôs once a year. I‚Äôm keeping an eye out for some faux leather gloves in a fun color for this year! That said, I think decent quality leather/faux leather gloves lined with a wool or cashmere blend and a hat and scarf in wool or cashmere are also good to have. They definitely keep me warmer than the cheap stuff. I have good luck at Sierra Trading Post (same company as Marshall‚Äôs/TJMaxx but focused on outdoorsy stuff) for that kind of thing.	episode_done:True
text:Buying vs selling on resell websites	labels:I bought/sold on Poshmark when it was starting to get popular, and found great deals and sold pretty easily on it. I stopped a year later - by that time, I had started seeing wholesale distributers flooding the site and making it alot harder for me to find actual used clothing for decent prices. I'd agree that there are likely too many sellers now compared to buyers - or at least too much merchandise compared to buyers. To me, that makes Poshmark too much like Ebay, and is no longer as distinct a platform as it used to be.  Edit: typos
text:I mean tbh I have a harder time with random people wondering why something they bought at target two years ago isn't worth retail price or above now and arguing that its out of production so it's worth more (girl it's our of production because they don't keep producing the same things season to season oh my God).   I think some of this comes down to the encouragement of bargaining on the platform. People will say they anticipate being offered a lower number so they'll overprice something, but if you're a buyer that's just an additional layer of hassle that would stop impulsive purchases which isn't great for getting things sold.	labels:	episode_done:True

Bralettes when they start to smell!
text:How do you separate your laundry? I‚Äôve been separating it by ‚Äútype‚Äù but everyone I know does it by color. Now I‚Äôm starting to wonder if I‚Äôm doing something wrong, but washing black underwear with black jeans just bc theyre the same color sounds so odd to me	labels:I always have my whites separate because it keeps the white 'crisp'.  I've found that washing whites in a mixed load can make them go dull or a bit grey looking. Sometimes I will put one or two light pastels in with them if I need to make up a full load- but only if I know they're colourfast.  I don't separate out all my other colors though.

text:Influencers with Jobs: A Brief Collection	labels:Style Apotheca on Youtube is a pharmacist!   I definitely prefer to keep up with influencers who have real jobs for a few reasons.   Firstly, I don‚Äôt love when every other post or video is an ad. It makes it difficult to differentiate between actual personal style content and what‚Äôs just an ad for a company I‚Äôm not interested in shopping at. I don‚Äôt like being Sold something every time I watch a style video, and I find you get that less from influencers who get income from day jobs.  Secondly, as you say, there is a bit more realism in what they‚Äôre posting. Style doesn‚Äôt happen in a void, it has to happen in our daily lives. I don‚Äôt wear four-inch heeled boots to work, and I don‚Äôt like watching a college-age girl try and make Work Relatable content by making ‚ÄúWork Outfits‚Äù with four inch heeled boots. Influencers who have day jobs understand what it is boring office employees like me are looking for in a work outfit üòä sure, maybe because of their ‚Äúinfluencing‚Äù work they spend more money buying high-end clothing items that I‚Äôm simply never going to justify buying, but I don‚Äôt tend to follow people like that for very long.

text:How to combine colors	labels:The easiest thing one can do is to just look at online clothes shops or catalogs. Look at how the outfits are put together with other colors. Also, if your primary goal is to see which colors match, don't limit yourself to looking at male clothes, women's section are often bigger if not more extensive than the men's selection; thus they're bound to have larger varieties of color coordinations. The H&M website is good one, since they often show the whole model head to toe.	episode_done:True

If you're new to the idea of dressing well or with intention, it may be worth holding off on springing for things.

But haven't had a lot of chances to wear them as special occasion pants , I got them end of last year and wore them twice out and once at home.   In the teal pant era (this was a long time ago) I wore them with my myriad of black and white tops - this is one of my faves. And also color blocking! If I can recall, I wore them with chartreuse, yellow, and pastel blues and greens. And light grey.   I love color blocking and often have had colorful bottoms, I just mixed them with whatever colors I felt were complementary. I had a couple of cobalt blue skirts, and I think some pants as well. This color goes well with just about any bright. I wore these with pinks, greens, and yellows.   In my brain, mustard yellow is a neutral, so it goes with basically everything. Hot pink pants - this for me, in my wardrobe, works with other shades of pink, maybe burgundy, grey, and yellow. I do to have many other colors outside of these, so that is what I wear.

text:How many pairs of jeans and pairs of shoes should you own?	labels:I think it's interesting that you hone in on "needs" when for many people fashion fills a hybrid function of both hobby and utility. Both shoes and purses seem prone to being "collector's items" moreso than other garments (leggings, sweaters, etc.) and it makes sense to me as a fashion hobbyist and collector that people would have more than they "need" or use regularly. Also, as people age they typically gain more buying power, space to store things, and access to various occasions (business events, formal events, lifestyle changes that may necessitate a wider variety of things to fulfill a wider variety of functions).   Furthermore, I haven't found this sub's focus on "purging"/closet cleaning reflected in real life--while people do obviously consign or donate old clothing, it's pretty common for people to keep things or simply put things in storage as their use wanes. So on that note, it seems unsurprising that people have a handful of things that see constant rotation and a handful of things that are rarely used but are still enjoyed, so there is no reason to get rid of them.

text:How do you guys work towards avoiding fast fashion?	labels:I second what everyone said about buying stuff secondhand, but just want to add, if you‚Äôre going to buy something from a fast fashion store, only buy it with as high a percent of natural fibers as possible. 100% cotton/silk/linen/wool/leather etc. The items will last longer and will look/feel better. Otherwise, you‚Äôre buying plastic clothing.	episode_done:True

I also like the madras pattern one (/r/NavyBlazer on suicide watch).
text:I like these themes a lot too, but I'm going to try to keep the schedule alternating because themes like these can be a little too open ended for newer users.	labels:This one also involved quite a bit of work from a new user.

Why is it different than other rubber boots? Cause it has a shank and it‚Äôs just so much more supportive. Also the part that‚Äôs usually more fragile is thick ass leather.

text:What do you get tailored?	labels:I get almost everything other than lounge clothes tailored. Size number means absolutely nothing anymore. Buy clothes that fit the widest part of your body, and have them taken in to fit the rest (it‚Äôs harder to let out than take in). Some of my dresses are 6s, and some are 0s, so size is literally just a made up concept for women. This definitely gets expensive, but I add the cost of tailoring to the cost of the thing I know I‚Äôll need tailored.   So like, if I see a skirt I really want, but I‚Äôll need the waist taken in, I know that my tailor streamlines waistbands with a zipper for 30 bucks. 35 if there‚Äôs a lining. That turns a $50 skirt into an $80 skirt. Do I really want to spend $80 on a skirt?? Maybe. If I do, I‚Äôll buy it. If not, I put it back. It ends up saving me money because I buy less impulse trendy purchases.   Find a good tailor by testing them on cheap pieces and building a reputation. Eventually, you‚Äôll know exactly how much they charge for each fabric/type of alteration and it helps with keeping prices in mind while shopping. A good tailor will have no problem at all with silks or satins. You may have to burn through a few and have them ruin some clothes before you find your soulmate, but it‚Äôs totally worth it! I recently broke up with my tailor and I‚Äôm still heartbroken about it..
text:Why did you break up with them?	labels:She could not for the life of her take something in at the zipper. Anytime something had a side zip and I needed the bodice taken in, it would end up all lopsided because she would only take out fabric from the opposite side. It wasn‚Äôt a huge deal, but she would get really upset if I asked to have something redone, and I noticed over time she would rush the easier jobs and they would end up a little sloppy. At her high prices, I got tired of being nervous about how something would turn out, so I stopped going. Now looking for a new tailor and starting the whole process over again üôÉ	episode_done:True

text:How do you actually incorporate colour in your wardrobe?	labels:Assuming you wear jeans and a t shirt now and then, go out and buy a cheap t shirt or two in a colour you like. If you find yourself wearing them regularly, buy some more bright items. If you don't wear them much, then perhaps bright colours are not for you, at least now, and you won't have spent much to find out.	episode_done:True

text:Adapting to age/workplace appropriate attire while staying true to yourself [discussion]	labels:I came to the following conclusion a few years ago:  >I am able to wear essentially anything I want anywhere I want.  However, **every single person I meet with functioning eyes** (whether they are aware of it or not) will pass judgment on my appearance no matter what I wear, and some of these people are in a position to materially affect my life based on their opinion of me.  I think it's unrealistic for most people to "wear what you want, screw the haters!" because appearance-based judgments happen constantly.  Is that a problem?  Heck yes.  Is it illegal?  When it comes to clothing, usually not.  The balance between "what I like" and "what won't get me ostracized and unemployed" is going to be very personal and will probably change several times in your life.  The trick is figuring out who you can't afford to *not* please (being realistic, of course), then figure out what is needed to please them, then figuring out where your creative freedom lies.   Most people have substantially more creative freedom in their off-work hours.	episode_done:True

text:What are some of your least favourite brands?	labels:I wouldn't say I inherently hate the brand but I think Champion is an example of a brand that exploded a few years back/to now basically all because some celebrities or whoever wore it- and everyone who wears it now is most likely a ding dong hypebeast type or the VSCO type girl or whatever. Like I'm old enough to remember it being bottom tier Wal Mart level shit you'd get borderline made fun of for wearing- but now all of the sudden it's enjoying this moment. So it's just that perceived inauthenticity and collective pivot in peoples' minds to a fashion name to people rather than just athletic apparel that irks me somehow.  However though, the Todd Snyder Champion stuff is PHENOMENAL- it's not the mainline stuff. You don't see any of those assholes rocking that.

If I didn't have that space I'd probably buy dust covers and a small rack or another door mounted thing.

text:What was your first 'expensive' fashion purchase?	labels:When I secured my post-bar-exam job and had figured out my budget, I bought a few classic silhouette Coach bags at the outlet during a sale. I spent maybe $250 on two bags and two wallets in neutral colors and felt like it was such an expensive splurge. I use each of them still and they've held up fairly well.    I'm *so* tempted to buy a Ted Baker coat or dress as my first expensive single item, but they're especially unnecessary due to the pandemic. There's no point in spending that money when I'm losing weight and have nowhere to show it off in the meantime. I'm totally tossing some savings away for splurging later though.	episode_done:True

text:Is Chanel going to be better off without Karl?	labels:Karl was a great creative and brought a lot of creativity to the brand, but it was A LOT different than Coco Chanel's classic, timeless, etc. His creativity helped elevate the brand with younger and trend-centric customers, which was good, without necessarily alienating the legacy customers who are not aspirational consumers buying the lower priced items but truly wealthy customers buying the $$$ items. It is a feat in itself to meet both, but that's also from excellent marketing and business team (not just him). The brand may be trying to cater more to its true wealth vs aspirational customers at the moment to keep the brand afloat during this time since the supply chain and margins are likely different, and the aspirational consumers are not able to buy as much due to impact on income, etc. But, fashion brands also play to the mood of the market, what more fashion-focused less trend-focused consumers are heading, etc. and it's global so it is much broader than just one country, etc. The new collection is still very fashion forward and very pretty. But, not as rocker/edge/creative as Karl's days. The thing with Chanel is that it has the younger aspirational consumer so hooked on its lower priced items, it really doesn't need to innovate for it - they consider the earrings, lower priced handbags, wallets, etc. to be status no matter what it is because they're buying the brand. Where, overall, it likely all works out. It's nice to see the change of vibe, but I did enjoy Karl's. His vibe was also getting a little tired, he was there forever. But, they are wise not to try to replicate him.
text:Of course people like Chanel because of the status quo the brand gives off but Karl impacted it to greater heights which we have seen today. It was a dead brand before Karl joined.	labels:The brand was huge before Karl, Coco was alive until 1971, and it was a major luxury brand at that time, before and after. He joined in 1983. But he did a great job at getting the mainstream aspirational consumer and young wealthy into the brand, which is what it needed. I know women who are in their 60s and 70s who have Chanel from way back when. There was a time after WW2 that the brand struggled a little, but so did nearly all luxury European brands at the time. Overall though it's always been a key brand in the category.
text:It was huge but it was struggling real hard to the point the owners wanted to just keep it as a perfume company. 11 designers after Coco's death. The Wertheimer brothers approached Karl and he is the one who changed the classic flap for the better and like you said made Chanel grand and even a larger status people aspire to be apart of.	labels:Agreed! I studied Chanel for a project, I love that we have both geeked out on Coco!
text:Did you learn something new?	labels:Not really. It was an analysis for something specific, but went back to the original start of Coco creating Chanel, which was all apparel, hats, etc. at that time, followed it through the fragrances, and then onto today for the project	episode_done:True

This will let you know where you stand with your wardrobe right now and you can build from there.     Personally, I just went though this and cleaned out my closet from all the all the old high school, college, and worn clothes I still had hanging around and my mind set was that ***it's better for me to throw away a little too much than too little***. Only do this if your in the financial situation where you know you can replace an article of clothing pretty easily though.

This is where I stock up on cashmere sweaters for a few dollars a piece, wool skirts, kilts, sweaters, vests, and cardigans, and amazing wool blazers and coats. I‚Äôve found mint condition mohair and camel hair 3/4 coats for as low as $10, black cashmere sweaters for $2-3 and up, and cable knit pullovers for as low as $4. It‚Äôs amazing what people get rid of, not realizing how expensive it all is new. I also loooove wool in the fall and winter, and so this has been a super affordable way to build a dream cold-weather wardrobe.   The only thing wool I buy new are socks for the most part, everything else I‚Äôve found at estate sales, garage sales, and thrift shops. When/if you go, definitely go through the boys and men‚Äôs departments, too. A bit of tailoring can make anything look custom like some of the pieces on Walker Slater maybe.

text:Light Down Jacket Inspiration Album	labels:For me personally, I really like light down jackets.  I know a lot of guides have solidified around the usual classics: harrington, denim, biker, and bomber jackets  but I find myself wearing my light down jacket more often.  They are super light. they fit well and have that same short cut like the others that looks cool. I don't have to worry about piling or shaping as much. they can be very warm too.    and more importantly I find them easier to layer under another coat, while the others fit a bit weirdly.  So light down jackets in fall and spring. then in winter, put them under a wind/water proof coat.  also pairs well with a sweater or fleece vest.	episode_done:True

My denim/stiffer fabric pants do get their own tiny set of drawers since I don't have a ton, but the rest of my clothes get organized in open shelving (IKEA Kallax.)  Shoes are in a shoe rack that I keep behind my closet door.  I have a ton of jewelry, so I have one of those over the door jewelry organizers, a bracelet holder, and I made myself a necklace holder out of wood, paint, and command hooks, since it was significantly cheaper than the one I liked.	episode_done:True

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - January 18, 2021	labels:Is there a secondary market for gift cards?  Got my friend a gift card to Spier and Mackay but he wants a vegan suit and their (very nice) customer service confirmed they don't do that.  Unfortunately they also don't do refunds on gift cards.  I don't need a suit, so I'm wondering if there are legit sites to resell this gift card at near-cost.	episode_done:True
text:How do some people put outfits together so effortlessly. Fashionista's please help.	labels:Hi! Former stylist.  1) Pay attention to the fit of things and figure out what cuts and shapes look good on you. Paper bag pants and some joggers have similar fits. Some mini skirts and shorts hit the same place on your legs and can have the same waist height. Find your sweet spot and don‚Äôt be afraid to buy multiple things in silhouettes that work for you.   2) Get some statement pieces that you would die for. If you are wearing a pair of jeans that fit well and a t-shit purchased within the past 3 years with some awesome earrings you going to look and feel great. If you are wearing an amazing dress and simple white sneakers you are going to look and feel great. Don‚Äôt overthink things but try and wear at LEAST one piece you are excited about at a time.   3) Don‚Äôt buy things just cause they are on sale, you saw your friend wearing it, or you feel like you ‚Äúneed‚Äù something in your wardrobe. You should love everything in your closet in its own special way unless it‚Äôs workwear and you hate your dress code for work. Something as simple as a T-shirt has so many different factors like cut, material, neckline, sleeve length. Purchase what feels good and don‚Äôt bother with the rest.
text:For 1. What pants do you recommend for people who are thin but carry a bit more weight in the core (stomach and butt) instead of their legs and thighs.	labels:It‚Äôs hard to say. Even for people who put on weight in the core does it go ‚Äúout‚Äù or ‚Äúsideways‚Äù? Everybody‚Äôs body is so different. It‚Äôs hard to tell what looks good without trying on different things but usually people are a pretty good judge of what ‚Äúworks‚Äù once they find it! Just keep an open mind and be willing to take stuff into a dressing room. A big butt or rounded stomach/hips can be sexy! If you are looking to ‚Äúhide‚Äù something however a good trick is to split it up -ie. layering or accessorizing with a belt, jacket, longer necklace etc.	episode_done:True

But both are out of the woods! They seem to be doing so much better and it's a huge relief!   Got a bunch of Aime Leon dore stuff from various sales and I got to say I'm very impressed. Nothing too flashy, but the Woolrich collection goes so hard. Also have to say, as much as I love some of Howlin' designs,  compared to the ALDxWoolrich stuff,  Howlin' quality is just not there. Surprised at how itchy the wool is. My gf got them as a full price Christmas gift though so can never say that out loud lmao.

text:I have made a realization that, apart from school uniforms, I only ever wear polo shirts	labels:I think as long as you avoid the synthetic fabric blends and look for high quality pique or sweater knit styles, polo shirts make an excellent staple.   I would explore polo shirts that have minimal branding and instead explore visual interest with contrast ribbing, or through muted sweater patterns.
text:Yeah it takes a little effort but a polo can work. I've been wearing them a lot lately for work from home since the collar is enough to make people think I'm not just lounging in my PJs but more comfortable than a button-down.

What gives with your "friend"?  Now, if you find yourself unable to do that -- you're STILL okay. And if you need help, obviously that's why Daily Questions etc exist.

text:I love dusty pinks and mauves.  I cannot express how badly those colors look with my skin. I've had *strangers* ask me if I was ok because they assumed someone who resembled a corpse that much must be actually nearing death.   I love heels and very sleek business casual as well as what I can only call ho-fits. I have bad ankles fr from working on concrete floors too many hours, and take public transportation. It's too much of a risk I could sprain my ankle from how much I walk, and I can't afford another sprain. My office is not business casual or sleek, but a no fuss "just don't wear t-shirts with slogans or anything" type of place. I am decidedly over my ho phase, despite my continued love of the clothes.   My fantasy of wearing heeled booties with a structured fashion blazer over a mauve dress is not any less real just because I have the common sense to not go through with it.  Fashion fantasy is still a valid form of participation!	labels:>I love dusty pinks and mauves.  >I cannot express how badly those colors look with my skin. I've had strangers ask me if I was ok because they assumed someone who resembled a corpse that much must be actually nearing death.  My way around this is that over the past 12-8 months Athleta and Lululemon have had a lot of merchandise in these colors so now I have a bunch of athleisure leggings, joggers, and culottes in shades that would make me look dead if they were anywhere near my face but are okay below the waist.

text:How would you describe the quality of self-knit/self-made clothes vs. store bought?	labels:It would depend on the skill and machinery of the sewist - I have definitely made clothes that I like and will likely keep wearing, but they‚Äôre not the most structurally beautiful garments and are not the same quality craftsmanship you‚Äôd get from a higher end brand. Part of it is equipment - I don‚Äôt have a serger which is used a lot in clothing making - and part of it is I‚Äôm not that concerned about the seams on the inside of a garment that only I will ever wear. That being said, if I had taken the time to do proper seams, there is no reason those garments wouldn‚Äôt last just as long as higher end garments.
text:For sewn pieces the investment in equipment needed to approach commercial operations is feasible for an individual, but in knitwear or complicated embroidery there's just no competition. 3D and digital looms are $$$$ and what a consumer pays for good yarn is a multiple of a large operation.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:She wasn‚Äôt a billionaire back then when she first used nylon. In fact, it was a risk and it didn‚Äôt perform well at first because factories weren‚Äôt configured for such a fabric and people had difficulty accepting a fabric common in workwear and industrial uses (parachuting) to be anything luxurious. So yeah in a way it was a statement against bourgeois taste.  Most natural fabrics today are cheap to the point where priced competitively to synthetics. Just because it‚Äôs affordable or synthetic doesn‚Äôt make it less luxurious.	labels:imo you shouldn‚Äôt have replied to them.   It‚Äôs clear they, like almost all of reddit, don‚Äôt know how to assess fashion and art on a conceptual level, and only on a surface/economical level.  Gabrielle making jersey fabric luxury, crickets. Miuccia making nylon gabardine luxury, trash.
text:Its not about assessing fashion and art. I can understand what she was doing and why its significant - and I can also be skeptical of its significance. Its goofy to me people would simp so hard for someone who "wanted to change the system from within" and apply leftist politics to market what is and remains a luxury brand - she even admits a fashion designer was antithetical to her political stance growing up, but she was too seduced by beauty to leave the world of fashion.   So color me none surprised when she goes on to become a billionaire off the backs of slaves.   My point isnt "nylon isnt luxury so she shouldnt sell cheap synthetics to rich people as a statement against fashion" its "being a luxury brand is antithetical in its very nature to the same politics you so self ascribe and market with - but the fact you found out a way to both use cheap materials with same upcharge and feel good about yourself is a perfect cherry to top it off"	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Are Luxury Fashion Brands Becoming Like Fast Fashion?	labels:Any time you're paying more than a few thousand dollars for a basic article of clothing, you're paying for the brand; because you could have that same blazer or pair of trousers custom made by a tailor/dressmaker in the same or better quality, for a lower price.  This was the case in the 50s and 60s as well, but at the time, high quality clothing was more common, sewing skills were more common, clothes were expected to last longer, and the general public had a better understanding of what good-quality clothing looks like; people bought Chanel expecting quality construction, of course, but the main appeal of buying from a prominent Parisian fashion house was knowing that anything Chanel made would be in fashion for the upcoming years.  Now that we are immersed in fast fashion, nobody has the knowledge to hold luxury brands accountable, and fashions change so quickly that a well-made 'up-to-date' jacket from a reliably fashionable brand would be a pointless investment.  It just doesn't make sense anymore for luxury brands to invest too much on quality if there is no longer any demand for quality.  This is not *only* a recent thing: I've seen gowns from the court of Marie Antoinette made of materials costing 30+ years of a working man's wages, yet were hastily thrown together with big, sloppy stitches and tacks.  That's just what happens when your client wants their garment *right now* and will only wear it once or twice.  If you want something that's really well-made and is going to last a long time, there is certainly a market niche for that, but it's become more of a middle-class niche for people who *specifically* care about quality and durability.

I was going to fashion school at the time and one of my profs noted that neutrals tend to come in style when the economy tanks because the pieces are more versatile. Like, there's only so many ways you can wear a bright pink top, but you can generally wear neutrals with everything.  Anyhow, I've noticed color palettes are trending more neutral again and I took it as a sign that fashion folks are taking into account that during the pandemic customers are trying to stretch their buys as far as possible.  Tbh, I don't feel strongly about it except that what I think it signifies makes me sad. I think it's triggering some minor trauma from my early adulthood and the recession ü§£
text:I think this too. And the capsule wardrobe riding in popularity is something that lends itself to this too. People are broke and minimalism is trending.  Also, I sort of feel like it‚Äôs a reaction to the ugly fashion trend.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:How does a warm weather wardrobe differ from a cold weather wardrobe?	labels:I live in Austin where the heat and humidity get prettyyy ridiculous. I pretty much live in skirts and shorts in the summer time. Tops-wise, I'm usually in short sleeves. If I'm daring to wear anything that doesn't show skin, it's loose and flowy!      No matter what clothes I wear, I think fabric makes the most difference. Polyesters and chiffons are the most miserable to wear in the heat and humidity because they're not breathable at all. Cotton and natural fibers all the way.      Hope that helps!
text:it does!!! thank you!!	labels:	episode_done:True
text:How many distinctly different outfits do you have?	labels:I also have a uniform!   My tops are usually either a black and white top or sweater. I have mostly skinny black pants and black skirts as bottoms. Even though they‚Äôre all Different to me I can imagine that they look the same to others.   I don‚Äôt particularly mind this because it feels like a signature look to me, and I think I look good in my outfits. To me, it just signifies that I know what I like and wear it on repeat! If you are happy with what you are wearing, I wouldn‚Äôt worry about trying to mix it up for the sake of mixing it up. I always think: do I, someone who likes clothing, remember what my officemate was wearing when I saw her two days ago? Nope! It‚Äôs probably safe to assume she doesn‚Äôt remember what I wore either. Heck, I don‚Äôt even remember what I was wearing myself.	episode_done:True
text:What ‚Äústatement pieces‚Äù are you looking forward to wearing this fall?	labels:My wardrobe is almost entirely different pieces of black clothing, so I picked up a pair of faux leather flare pants at the beginning of summer and can‚Äôt wait to finally wear them! I‚Äôm typically an avid leather jacket-wearer in the fall and winter months so I‚Äôm excited to incorporate the material in a different way this year.  Also just mixing and match different textures is something I love doing this time of the year considering I live in a relatively cold place (Colorado), so layering a bunch of different cozy fabrics is something else I‚Äôm excited for!	episode_done:True
text:Purses: Real vs. Faux Leather?	labels:Personally I try to avoid faux if possible. Real leather lasts longer, faux leather is just plastic and I find it cracks and/or scuffs usually within a couple years. Granted, I haven't bought any luxury faux leather so maybe that would last longer. Also on the sustainability side I feel like real leather is better (although I'm sure it depends on processing and where it comes from)
text:Leather production is really terrible for the environment too, but since it lasts a looot longer and afaik is waaay more degradable, it's still by far the more environmentally friendly choice unless you purchase a whole lot of it.	labels:To add to this, there are places that offer vegetable dyes and make sure that the tanning process isn't bad for the workers and the environment.  You can also try to find brands that use recycled leather or use secondhand leather to lessen the environmental impact.   And ultimately, it will eventually biodegrade which is something I can't say about my peeling, sad faux leather jacket that I've only had for 3 years!	episode_done:True

text:Colour/Style Matching - How do I figure out the potential of my wardrobe?	labels:1. Start slow! Save images that inspire you- whether it be print/ social media or random photos on the internet.  2. Take these images and see if there are any elements of your wardrobe that work. Eg the image shows a woman in a black turtleneck and a plaid skirt. You have a cream turtleneck But don‚Äôt have a plaid skirt. You do however a a similar style skirt in navy.  3. If I pick what to wear every morning I would always gravitate to the same items. I spend at least half an hour every Sunday figuring out my Monday- Friday outfits. This gives me time to experiment and try on new combinations. Sometimes things will work in my head don‚Äôt work in person and that‚Äôs okay! It also means that I can make sure I have the right underwear/ tights etc so I don‚Äôt panic in the morning.	episode_done:True
text:Are there any alternatives to a suit that you know about or your culture uses?	labels:In bangladesh for formal occasions you might wear a normal suit, but more common is a Panjabi and white Paijama. They are both basically made of thin fabric so are good for summer. The panjabi is often a deep colour with a lot of embroidery, but you can get light coloured simple ones too. Pair it with leather shoes or sandals.   My dad personally wears a panjabi with suit trousers and a suit jacket. We live in england. I only bring out the panjabi for special occasions like weddings
text:That's fascinating! I'm checking out the images now and it seems like exactly the kind of formal wear I was thinking about: ornamental, sleek, and appropriate for the climate. Mixing it with a jacket is also an interesting hybrid. It allows you to be sensible, express your culture, and take ownership of what was essentially a British standard set on the world. I might look into exploring a combination of a guayabera with "suit" like ornamentation.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Big Coats	labels:Unrelated to the coats, but I think the picture for #28 (Onkul) was taken at pizza slice in Shibuya.  Kinda funny to see a place I‚Äôve been to show up in the background of a fashion shoot	episode_done:True
text:MFA Theme WAYWT: Casual Tailoring	labels:This stuff looks great and the idea is nice in theory but after years of attempting this and being ‚Äúthat guy‚Äù, it really doesn‚Äôt work outside of the largest/most fashionable locales (NYC, London, Paris, Southern Europe, etc.). If you really want to do this and are comfortable with it then by all means go ahead. But from my own experience I did this, and actually did it fairly well after many years, but at the end of the day it stood out too much in real everyday life in a normal town, regardless of how nice the outfit was, and it definitely hurt my social reputation a lot. After toning it down a bit I immediately noticed a difference in how much more positively I was treated by people. You can still dress well, but remember context is key.
text:I don‚Äôt necessarily disagree, I spent two years trying to wear the basic bastard in a suburban high school before realizing how fucking goofy that looked(funny how my awkward phase looking back is gonna be the time I **wasn‚Äôt** emo lmao), but the point of this post isn‚Äôt really to tell you how to dress without any content, it‚Äôs just a loose theme for the regulars WDYWT posters to participate in, a way to explore or flesh out a style, and showcase that to other people here. You DON‚ÄôT need to look at it and go ‚Äúbut I couldn‚Äôt wear this where I live‚Äù because it‚Äôs not asking you to dedicate yourself to perusing this as your primary aesthetic, just a ‚Äúhey this an option‚Äù  Also it‚Äôs always kinda funny to see what people consider ‚Äúout there‚Äù, it leans more dressy for sure, that‚Äôs the point, but outside the couple of all black darkwave fits in there most of this is pretty average	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What are your go-to, everyday shoes?	labels:Blundstones in the winter, white keds in the summer. I'm a simple gal. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è  Side note, I wear orthodics so my shoe choices are based on whether I can rip out the insole and fit my orthodics. Unfortunately this means no sandals during the summer unless I really think it's worth it to sacrifice cuteness for knee pain!

text:Hand wash only clothes	labels:I have an excellent tip for this! Get a large salad spinner and some gentle lingerie soap, put your really delicate stuff in with some warm water and detergent, spin a hand-full of times and let it soak for 5 mins, drain the water out and fill it with cold water, let it soak for 5, then spin, drain, refill, spin drain repeat till it comes out clear. Takes maybe 15 mins total and you don't destroy your clothing. You can even spin it again once the water is out to speed up drying if you let it air dry.

text:General Discussion - October 30	labels:probably my least favorite lurker take is "there's not a lot of style variety represented here :/"   First off, that's not even remotely true.

text:Who else has sensory issues that has figured out ways to not dress boring?	labels:I have SPD (sensory processing disorder) and I have some serious issues. If it‚Äôs itchy, stiff, makes swishy noises as I walk, weirdly textured, I won‚Äôt wear it. For sweaters I stick with cotton only or if it‚Äôs a blend, it better be silky smooth. No wool, alpaca, cashmere or acrylic.   For tops I stick to cotton, silk or flannel. Madewell, LL Bean and Jcrew make tops that I can wear comfortably.   I wear modal long underwear in the winter if I will be cold. I also wear modal pajamas because it‚Äôs soft and washes well.   I don‚Äôt have a ton of issues with pants. I can‚Äôt do paper bag or flares as it‚Äôs swishy. And I can‚Äôt do super high rise (10in or higher) because it pushes on my stomach and I can‚Äôt handle that lol.

That community makes reddit look like a Churc picnic in comparison.
text:Imgur users always forget that their social media platform of choice was created solely to host images and gifs for Reddit. So they don't comprehend how an image wasn't posted to entertain them on that platform, and if it doesn't entertain them, they screech like banshees about it. The substance of any fashion-related image comments I see are what I imagine an internet edgelord middle schooler that thinks video game graphic tees are the height of fashion would write.  I can't fathom just surfing that god awful designed site for hours, and just up and down voting things and making comments with a character limit smaller than Twitter's.	labels:Yes, seriously, this.

text:Fast Fashion: What are your wardrobe all-stars?	labels:When I studied abroad in France, in 2007, I bought a cute belted gray coat with a funnel neck from Etam. I wore it for a while and then handed it over to my sister. I think it cost ‚Ç¨34.  She still wears it every winter.	episode_done:True
text:How do deal with being pressure to find ‚Äúclassics‚Äù and ‚Äútimeless pieces‚Äù when you feel your style is constantly changing?	labels:I buy/wear items that I like, whether they are in style or not, whether they are considered classic or not. For example, I love high waist pants and maxi skirts - both were "trendy" a couple years ago and I'm so glad they were produced more as a result. I will keep wearing them even though they're no longer trendy, because I love how they look and feel, even if no one else is wearing them.   Another example for me: neutral colors are considered classic, as well as patterns like plaid and houndstooth. But I love fun colors and funky patterns, so those are what I wear most, no matter if others are wearing different styles.  Just because something is labeled classic or trendy by social media, fashion brands, retailers, etc. doesn't mean that we have to adhere to them. You can wear whatever style you like, whenever you like, regardless if others woild label those items trendy or classic.	episode_done:True
text:Is Y2K fashion coming back organically or is it a result of progressing the 90's comeback to the next decade since that trend seemed to work out?	labels:i personally disagree that there are no aesthetic reasons for y2k fashion to come back. there definitely are, or else it wouldn't be as huge as it is!! i personally love a lot of aspects of y2k fashion. :) but you're right that nostalgia is a huge part of it. nostalgia as a whole is so trendy these days. for example my whole tiktok is full of people talking about shows from their childhood, or toys, or disney channel stars from our childhood. "1999, 2004, 2008" picture day tiktoks are also a huge trend right now. i've even seen tons of people talking about 2011-2014 nostalgia which wasn't even that long ago!! it's insane how it's such a big thing. i'm honestly more interested in analyzing why everyone's so nostalgic in general these days haha

text:Somebody else loosing so much time to choose the right item to buy when looking for something? I feel it cost me more in time when I try to buy responsibly.	labels:Yeah, shopping responsibly and buying only from more sustainable/ethical brands can be frustrating and time consuming.   I've found having a go to list of brands I've purchased from before is a good way to narrow down a search. For one-off more specialist purchases, I start looking early and just accept it's going to take a while before I buy what I need.
text:Do you have example of brands that are for you a staple? I'm from Canada, it might not be available but who knows !	labels:It depends what I'm looking for but Organic Basics for underwear, Linen Fox for main wardrobe pieces (their style is exactly what I enjoy wearing), People Tree and Thought Clothing although they're a different to my style they do have some good basic wardrobe pieces.	episode_done:True

We've come a long way from "well dressed men wear suits" to "actually shirts and blazers can be dressed down" to "actually you can wear what you want and look good", and maybe the whole "timeless", "dapper", "classic", "gentleman" thing was a necessary part of the journey, but... would it just fucking die please.

text:My incomplete guide for buying less in 2021	labels:I cleaned out and organized my entire closet earlier this year. I sold what no longer fit and things I haven't worn in a while. I use the money I make from selling my old clothes to purchase new items. I put my entire capsule wardrobe onto a Powerpoint, so I can see what items I need or would like to add. Then, I shop around for the pieces I want and save them to my Shoptagr extension in Chrome. The extension keeps all my wishlist items in one place, and alerts me then they are discounted. This keeps me from impulse-buying just because something is on sale, since I know these are things I have been wanting for a while.  I also unsubscribed from all newsletters, but I follow the brands I like on a website called Milled, which is a search engine for email newsletters. It lets me follow all the brands I typically shop at, but because the newsletters don't go directly to my inbox, I'm not as tempted to purchase. It's also helpful to look back through the brand's emails, just to get a sense of their sale patterns.	episode_done:True
text:Women who have moved for extended periods of time on 1 or 2 suitcases only, how did you do it? Here's the beginning of my process	labels:My job has made me a nomad (I WFH now to most offices being shut down).  However, only 1 of my assignments over the last decade had me travel by air.  The rest of the time, I simply loaded up my car.  I am no minimalist (fashion wise, I am in other parts of my life) and a capsule wardrobe has zero appeal to me.  I typically hit the road for anywhere from 2-6 months at a time.  When I flew, my luggage was 1 wheeled carry on size suitcase (the largest carry on size allowed), 1 larger checked bag, and a backpack (I gate checked the carry on suitcase when they were looking for people to gate check bags).  I was able to fit enough clothes for 2 months into those because I also brought a collapsible mesh laundry basket with me along with laundry pods (which I otherwise do not use).  My caveat is that due to my industry (US politics), everything is domestic.  I've never traveled internationally as an adult.
text:If I could drive there I would definitely feel more secure. My greatest packing achievement yet was packing 1 suitcase + 1 backpack for 2 months, 5 countries and 4 different ranges of weather. I was able to fit everything I needed without having to shop, but I can't imagine surviving on it for an entire year without resorting to minimalism. It just seems so boring to me, I can't see myself looking like me in those types of clothing	labels:One thing I think a lot of minimal capsule wardrobe inspo images don‚Äôt show is that you don‚Äôt HAVE to do only neutrals. This is a revelation I just had recently ‚Äî I came to the end of about 2 years of personal style exploration and put together a capsule wardrobe to see if it would work for me. I‚Äôm all about colors and floral patterns, so for me the trick was to choose everything in a color palette that would mix & match. My colors are navy blue, coral pink, yellow, and dark green. Almost all of my items were one or more of those colors, and everything interchanged really easily, even though I only had 20 items or so.   You said fashion is how you express yourself. What are the consistencies between your favorite pieces? Do several of your pieces already go together? That might be the basis for creating a ‚Äúminimal‚Äù wardrobe that still feels expressive and in line with your personality.
text:I've started mapping out my clothing and a lot of my things go together and everything I own is either floral or polka-dot, I've tried sticking with a colour scheme but I love too many of them. In the last 4 years I've gone through navy-black-maroon, grey-blue-black, orange-yellow-black, dark green-navy-black- brown,and the past year I've been a solid black-white-hot pink.  So I've ended up with a crazy mix.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:When did skinny jeans go out of fashion?	labels:Women in fashion have stated that skinny jeans have been out for years now. They at first were replaced with mom jeans, than wide leg coulotts, than the high rise straight leg and now I'm seeing a lot of low rise boot cut. That being said in everyday life I am still seeing a large majority of women still wearing skinny jeans
text:This skinny vs wide leg debate has made us forget about the true enemy-low rise jeans.	labels:This is the one thing I will complain and warn the youths about. I was a teenager when low rise jeans were all the rage in the aughts. Never again. Learn from our mistakes. Especially since it seems shirt length hasn't totally caught up to low-rises. Fighting dress code and having to sit in low-rise jeans in a classroom was hell.
text:In high school I had this one pair of ultra-low rise ultra skinny Hollister jeans.

text:I also wonder if men tend to buy clothing staples, and clothes for women tend to be on trend. So, we get cheaply made fast fashion that has extra development costs.	labels:100% because it's pretty easy to sell women stuff if you make them feel bad about themselves. I've recently been actively avoiding fast-fashion and buying more high-quality stapes, I end up buying a lot of "unisex" clothes.	episode_done:True
text:People who used to play super safe with fashion, how did you overcome your fear of bold choices?	labels:I wear it at home. So I can get used to it without others seeing me. After a bit I suddenly feel more comfortable.   Also, avoid mirrors! This helped massively when I was trying to get comfortable wearing bright lipsticks.
text:I will definitely keep this in mind, thank you! You're right, now that I think about it, pretty much all the time I spend in front of the mirror has always been to criticize and never to be satisfied.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Revisiting Tim Gunn's List of 10 Style Must-haves	labels:To me, this is ‚Äúwardrobe staples if you have a traditional office job with a business dress code‚Äù tbh. I do, so I own a version of most of these, but that kind of work environment is less and less common, and I think a lot of women no longer have much use for blazers, trench coats, dress pants, etc.
text:I feel like this list can be modernized by stating an item's function, rather than defining what the items themselves should be.   For instance, instead of the blazer and dress pants, the description "an outfit well-suited for a professional job interview" would work well, and then one could discuss various pieces that could work within these constraints, such as a well-fitting cardigan and a pencil skirt.   Instead of a "little black dress," what they really mean is "an easy and versatile somewhat-formal piece" that's suitable for anything from a work happy hour to a holiday party and is easy to dress up or down. Doesn't have to be a dress, doesn't have to be black, but something that has the same level of versatility and formality that's appropriate for multiple occasions.   Instead of "classic white shirt," could mean a "versatile neutral top" that can be coordinated multiple ways across multiple contexts, worn casually on its own or as a foundation piece under a pantsuit. "Trench coat" is similar--a piece of outerwear that has trend longevity and can be worn atop most outfits, but obviously this changes depending on your climate; a down coat could fill this wardrobe niche if you're somewhere cold.	labels:	episode_done:True

Well, today the USPS emailed me that they just approved my insurance request and I should be receiving a refund soon. That's a fucking 7 month delay.

text:Guidance organizing a suit for my fianc√© for his father's funeral during lockdown	labels:Navy slacks without a pattern and white shirt (tie is not my area). Mismatch of fabric is critical in this case because you are not building suit, but rather classical sport coat and slack combi.
text:The suit looks dark grey to my eye, though monitor may be misleading.  If it is indeed dark grey/charcoal, I would not recommend navy pants, I'd suggest a lighter grey with no pattern that is very noticeably lighter than the jacket. Agree with the above poster that the goal here isn't to match, but to contrast in a... Controlled... way, especially since you're planning for a funeral.  White shirt, simple/plain tie in any dark color (black or grey would be traditional for a funeral, but dark blue, burgundy, or dark green would be fine as well).	labels:Thank you.

text:What's been your experience with men's stores/departments?	labels:I have shopped the men's department before and never had issues with sales associates. The biggest thing was once, they wouldn't let me in the dressing room and I had to go to one on another floor, because there were already men in there (but everyone had their own room and the only communal space was the mirror area? Like, not sure why it mattered, I ended up making the purchase at the register near the other dressing room and the guy lost a sale, which may have been petty but...I'd used that dressing room before with zero issue, so ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è) But I have had issues with some cuts of men's clothes--they aren't really cut for boobs and hips, so I had to get them tailored.

I purchased a shirt in my exact size and it was too short, so I'm thinking I could order it with longer sleeves or a slightly bigger neck and just get it tailored (assuming it will make it longer).

text:Technical/Labwear but make it fashion	labels:I've been working on construction sites for for years, and I've found that my work wear influences my fashion sense more than my fashion sense influences my workwear  I'd say the only influence fashion has on my workwear is cut. I wear skinny carpenter's jeans and make sure that my shirts, jackets, and high viz vest are all fitted at the waist. This is mostly so I don't look like a child, though, and less about fashion  I wear quality boots to work every day, so now I tend to buy my fun shoes from places prioritize comfort, weatherproofing, and sole grip. Less ASOS, more Sorel  I love Dovetail jeans, which have taught me the joys of a pocket for every tool. Now, my favorite purse is a crossbody wallet from Duluth because it has slots for all my cards and cash and two pockets that are perfect for my phone and my facemask.  Basically, construction has taught me to prioritize dressing practically so I can live my best life without digging for shit deep in a massive purse while dying in uncomfortable shoes.

Make no mistake, I love a good suit, and I wear them regularly - but it definitely is the outfit worn by the greatest terrorists and mass murderers on earth. Maybe it's time we let politicians express themselves.

text:Wardrobe Problems: Separates	labels:Yeah, I wear dresses probably like 80-90% of the time, I think, and usually if I'm not wearing a dress then I'm wearing a skirt! For me it's just that it's easier to find dresses and skirts that fit better off the rack so they need a lot less tailoring, whereas jeans and trousers need a lot of tailoring for me and it gets expensive and time-consuming.  I have a lot of jumpers because I often wear them over a dress in autumn/winter, but otherwise my selection of tops is woefully pitiful haha. I quite like a nice lightweight camisole tucked into shorts or a skirt in summer though! But generally I don't wear a lot of separates (easier to coordinate that way too üòÜ).	episode_done:True

text:Advice needed: How to keep up with trends without social media?	labels:Your best bet is going old school and following blogs. Set up an RSS feed, find people you like, and follow fashion that way.   But this is also a good time for you to explore YOUR personal style, without the influence of... uh... influencers. Obviously some of the fun of fashion is finding out what the trends are as dictated by other people, but with a little freedom from those, you might create silhouettes and combinations that are far more interesting to you personally than whatever's popping off on IG this week.  You can also do what I do and set up an IG that's just for this kind of thing. I don't follow anyone I know, I don't post anything on there. It's just for me to keep up with fashion, some bands I like, and a few owls managed to sneak their way in there. If you set up something like that, you can set aside an hour on the weekend and get caught up on fashion stuff without even installing the app on your phone. A lot of influencers are on YouTube too, so if you'd prefer to stay away from IG altogether, you can just look for their YouTube pages and watch their content on the weekend.

text:What are novelty leather keyrings/keychains for? How do you use them?	labels:Just a PSA for anyone who keeps them on the same key ring as your car key.   My locksmith gather told me that heavy key rings or chains or lots and lots of keys attached to a key you put in your car ignition causes the ignition to wear out quicker and require replacement.  Not a problem in the push button cars these days but something to think about if you regularly drive a car that isn't.	episode_done:True

text:What was your "how in the name of all that is holy did this end up in a thrift store" find?	labels:It‚Äôs less about the value of the item and more about the stars aligning perfectly.  I wear a size 12-13W shoe, plus other things that make my feet really hard to fit, so I am used to buying formalwear to match the one maybe two pairs of formal shoes I own at any given time.  So when I was 17 and going to prom in 2006, my mom tried really hard to help me find shoes, any shoes, that were suitable. But we could only find casual flats or runners, and I realllly wanted to dress up nicely for the first real time in my life. So she said ‚Äúyou know what, let‚Äôs buy a dress and then we will just have to find a way.‚Äù  So I picked out a black and pale pink dress that just made me swoon, and I figured black heels would be easiest to find. Lol I was so young and stupid.  Anyway we searched high and low right up until the week of prom, we drove to the US from Canada and looked there and I still couldn‚Äôt find a pair of heels that fit enough to buy and I decided I‚Äôd just wear uncomfy like always and deal with it.   Then I randomly walked into a thrift store and saw on the shoe rack a pair of pink heels in the exact shade of pink on my dress, with black trim. Picked them up, size 12W. They fit like they were made for me.   Wore them until they broke three years ago.

text:What is the breakdown of $ spent for various outfits you actually wear?	labels:Maybe ¬£100-300 for the whole outfit. More so ¬£300 at this time of the year I'd guess.  Most expensive things are jacket and shoes which make up about 3/4 of the price for me.  Shoes I always buy new and expensive cause my feet suck. So ¬£50-150.  Jackets are second most expensive and I try to always buy second hand. Got a few Barbour's and vintage coats for ¬£10-50.  Jeans/trousers are a pain to buy second hand because the fit is normally crap. Maybe ¬£50.  The rest is all second hand. Jumpers/shirts/t shirts. Can easily find that all super cheap on eBay, depop or in thrift stores.  Or my full suit which is ¬£300 including tailoring. SO used to work in a suit shop and got discount on that one. I think it was 50% off.	episode_done:True

text:Ladies with eczema or sensitive skin, what kind of leisure wear, tights, and leggings do you buy?	labels:I've found that cotton is best, with up to 5% spandex. It's not a sexy look, but cotton flannel pyjamas are very comfy and cause no skin issues for me. I also have a couple pairs of cotton-stretch joggers from Amazon for home wear, and a pair of truly ancient 100% viscose leggings (they're basically see through now, which is probably why they're so soft). Honestly I usually wear a cotton dress around the house though - I find anything tight-fitting on the legs can cause trouble.  For tights, Falke has always been more comfortable than average for me. I buy a size up, which seems to reduce the pressure and itching.	episode_done:True

text:Accessories newbie and am not sure where to start...what are your must-have starter pieces?	labels:I think it would be good to start with some gold and silver necklaces that you can layer like basic chains with charms and some some hoop earrings, pearls, or diamond studs. You can even get some colorful jewelry for statement pieces or a pop or color. And I would say get a black belt and a brown belt cause they can go with anything almost.
text:Great ideas, thank you! I just realized...I don't own any belts! Haha so that's on my list now too.	labels:If you're into thrifting, belts are a great piece to buy second hand! So many cool statement belts, and almost always tons of classic leather staples belts too.	episode_done:True

text:FAQ: What are people's experiences with clothing challenges like trying not to buy clothes for a year/only buying second hand? What are some tips?	labels:I tend to wear clothes until they are rags. It‚Äòs just not an expense that ever tempts me. If the pandemic weren‚Äòt a thing, maybe it‚Äòd be different. I think the last time I got new clothes besides socks was like...2-3 years ago.    Treat it like any other expense. If you feel the temptation to buy, force yourself to wait a few days to see if you realllly want or need it. Or just take the cost of the clothes you want and put it in your savings.	episode_done:True
text:I'm Not a Watch Guy I Swear - Street x Sprezza	labels:I am a watch guy, but very much a relatively broke one.  Had I known how much trouble it would be to break into watches, I might have said never mind and wisely walked away. I didn‚Äôt, though.   Some pointers for those interested:  1.	The cost of the watch is only the upfront cost. Like a car, a mechanical watch needs regular maintenance. Generally speaking, this will be anywhere from $300 to $1,000+...every 5-7 years.  2.	Because of point #1, entry level (~ $500) mechanical watches are not pieces you will pass down to your kids. In fact, it is usually cheaper to trash them entirely and buy new than to bother having them serviced.  3.	People will tell you there are deals to be had in the vintage market. That‚Äôs true, but it can also be difficult to find parts or people willing to work on them. 4.	There is relatively little offered between entry level and about $3,000.  5.	There is nothing wrong with wearing a quartz or digital watch.   All that being said, I still love my small collection. Just wish I had known those things from the start.

It‚Äôs a v-neck that is not cut too low, which I like b/c it doesn‚Äôt show a tuff of my chest hair like some other brands do.	episode_done:True

You've definitely been aspirational to me over the years and your reflections are very insightful. Inspires me to want to take outfit photos and see what my style evolution will look like in a few years. ;)  Edited to add: A lot of your experiences also resonated with me, as I too have moved to London in the last few years and have specifically purchased items because "It's what __ would wear!" or to replicate an exact outfit I saw on Instagram. If you have any tips on how to find items you love - and not because you loved it on someone else - I'd be keen to hear it. I'm *still* learning what my style is, and I'm over 30!	episode_done:True

text:Discussion: LGBTQIA+ Signaling, Presentation, and Commodification in Fashion	labels:At some point I wanted others to know I'm gay from meeting me, so I got a pixie cut and called it good. It was a bad haircut, it didn't feel like "me", and guys still hit on me. I've gone through other time periods where others couldn't tell my sexuality from my appearance. This was something I was proud of, due to internalized homophobia. (But other queer women always knew. It's the vibe.)  Now, I'm more comfortable with myself and comfortable playing around with masc/femme in how I dress and present. I've made a few subtle changes with my clothes. But what has really made a difference is allowing myself to use more masculine mannerisms - the way I stand, the way I talk, the way I carry myself. In the past I've felt awkward in social settings despite being an extrovert, and I've recently realized this is mainly due to the dissonance between the gender role I'm expected to perform, and what's going on internally. By accepting my androgynous/masculine side, I've started to feel free of awkwardness.  To me, queer fashion is not one thing. There are many different queer and lesbian fashion styles. Just like straight people, we have different subcultures and styles within queerness. You got your art queers, your sporty queers, your co-op queers, your preppy queers. But there's often an element of playing with and mixing masculine and feminine and androgynous, both in the clothes and the way you wear them and the way you act.	episode_done:True
text:I keep getting moth holes in suit jackets - how to solve problem?	labels:Take all the clothing out of that closet and have it all cleaned. Before putting it back, vacuum and clean the fuck out of the closet. Woodwork, corners, cracks in the wood floor, etc. Wash it down and let it dry completely with a fan. Buy some moth traps and hang them in the empty closet. All they do is show the presence of the moths... which lay the eggs and spawn the larvae which eat the clothes. But if you have the traps in the closet for a couple months and see no moths stuck to it, you should be good. Only then put your clean clothes back in the closet. Google around for some chemical pesticide control, too. Cedar is a myth... but it does smell nice! And clean the fuck out of the room the closet is in, too.  Anything wool should be put away clean in sealed plastic bins or ***sealed*** bags. You can't seal everything all the time. So, keeping the door open helps, too. The bugs like complete darkness and trapped air. Move the clothes around from time to time. They like tightness, moisture, and dark conditions. They like to eat oil-stained clothing. Don't overstuff things in the closet.  It's a lot of stuff to do, but if you DO have a problem, you have to really get rid of them thoroughly and completely or it'll just keep happening. So don't half-ass it.  These techniques worked for me. They aren't a nightmare like bed bugs, but it takes work or they just come back.  PRO TIP: quarantine any wool items that have been held in a rental storage space. That's what happened to me. Someone else has bugs, and they find your stuff.  I had moved and had some clothes and wool rugs stored for just a couple  months. They destroyed my one (very nice) wool oriental carpet. Quarter-sized holes. It wasn't as bad a problem for my clothes, but I freaked out with the rugs and went ballistic on my new closets and clothes. I haven't had a problem in over two years now.	episode_done:True

I like how some things fit/match better than others.    What I‚Äôve tried to do to try and get out of these habits are. 1. Try and post a ‚Äúfit pic‚Äù once a week on Instagram where I‚Äôm wearing something different, might be the same vibe but it‚Äôs different. 2. Think of clothes as toys from toy story and I want them to be happy they‚Äôre being used. 3. If I like how one out fit looks, I‚Äôll try to recreate that outfit with the other clothes I have. Ex. A white shirt and blue pants could mean a button up, long sleeve, short sleeve, or hoodie then different washes of jeans, slacks, different pant cuts.	episode_done:True

text:Tips for easily looking more modern/in style?	labels:Hi,  I think you have to consider what is modern in your country/area/city if your goal is to appear modern. Eg tight leather pants and overknee boots were quite modern where I live 1-2 years ago but they would seem outdated now, but I still see them on instagram in other countries.  But generally, for a vibe, I would look at early seasons of friends (monika!) and fashionable movies and music videos (eg don't speak!) from the early to mid 90s for silhouettes, trouser cuts and articles of clothing you can add to your wardrobe. Other posters already got more detailed so I'll skip that.  Also I think looking at the websites of fashion forward brands like Zara and Monki help with finding out whats modern in terms of silhouettes, combinations and color stories without having to necessarily buy from them.
text:Thank you for the tips!!! I havent really shopped from monki before but imma go check it out!	labels:hey, sorry for the late reply!

I don't want to discourage you, just my two cents as someone who had a very similar thought process  I went back to tank tops and sweatpants and I find I appreciate them a lot more now. I make sure they fit properly and don't have stains or holes so I still feel reasonably put together.
text:As a counterpoint, I wear similar clothes to bed (silk nightdresses that hit mid thigh), and I find that even if I'm a mess when I wake up, I still feel great in them. Like, effortlessly sexy even though my hair looks like a tornado visited me in the night. They're the most comfortable type of garment I've found to sleep in as well (but I know I'm in the minority with that opinion).

That being said, skinny jeans are pretty much staples for most people. They go with a lot of outfits and make a lot of looks.   Just because something isn't currently on trend, does not mean it can't be stylish.

text:Does anyone else use a ‚Äúformula‚Äù to create their outfits?	labels:I generally find its easier to base your outfits around one piece, often an accent piece or statement piece. I got the idea from storytelling/art composition seminars, its infinitely more easy to come up with a composition once you know what your main character is interacting with scene/item wise. The same applies to outfits, once you have your main piece for that outfit you can decide how casual/dressed up you want to be, whether you need to add more textures, and what colors will match with said pieces color.  Generally I stick to the rules of trying to match the metals/detailing of outfits, trying to either go with neutrals for primary pieces with skintone matches to accents, or going with monochrome outfits(which generally look very stylish automatically). Fit wise, I generally make sure that I alternate between loose up top/form fitting below the waist, or vice versa. Silhouette is the most important thing, I try to go for clean lines.  Pattern wise I limit them to one pattern max, the same goes for textured pieces.	episode_done:True
text:All-time favorite cold weather pieces?	labels:Any recs for winter boots/slippers that either have excellent arch support or that I can use orthotic insoles in?

I cannot even walk around the house barefoot. üò• At home I have been just wearing wool socks with a pair of birkenstocks. But I miss the feeling of wearing comfy, warm, slippers.	episode_done:True
text:What are people's experiences with clothing challenges like trying not to buy clothes for a year/only buying second hand? What are some tips?	labels:The problem is that doing a no-buy for a year is a HUGE undertaking that you are destined to fail. Not just you, people, in general. I think 3 months is a great start, and I think it's easier if you start with smaller, more attainable goals. It's like with a project at school or work - you break it up into smaller increments.  Once you get the hang of it, it'll be WAY easier to extend another month and another month. Looking at a year of no-buy is daunting. 3 months? More manageable.   The other thing is - you can't go cold turkey, because that is also unrealistic and sets you up for failure. I'd start with a low-buy, a circumstantial buy, a no-buy with a number of exceptions, etc. That enables you to form better habits.  The less strict you are being with yourself, the better your chances of success, overall, and long-term. If you go hard (one full year no-buy, no exceptions, fuck yeah!!!), it'll be super easy to break down and lose your progress, because the minute you give in, you've "failed" and what's the point of continuing. This is an endurance run.  Eventually, you get excited at your progress and want to see it through till the end. This is what helped me start saving money. I wanted to save for a deposit, but man, setting aside that first $1000 was hard. But once I saw my bank account growing and growing as months went by, it became easier. It became thrilling. How much could I save? How much closer to my goal could I get?   It's satisfying to see the progress, and it's harder to give up once you've made a "dent" in your ultimate goal.
text:Ohh thank you for your advice! I love this idea- I think that yeah, I don't really want to go without buying a dress for a special occasion from time to time. But yeah, saving is really addictive!! I totally agree that starting off slow is the best way to go about this!!	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - December 13, 2020	labels:Slacks are the most comfortable items in my wardrobe short of sweaters. Why do so many men hold the sentiment that ‚Äúdressing up‚Äù equates to being uncomfortable? I just went to a Christmas service at an employee‚Äôs rural church where everyone wears jeans or other 5 pocket pants and oxfords. No problem with that at all, but 4 or 5 people made comments about my slacks/shirt/tie/bomber jacket/boots(he said be casual...I still over dressed with the tie) with things like ‚Äúman I‚Äôm glad someone can wear those‚Äù.   Who hurt these people? Are teenage men being put in some awful $99 suits and being traumatized? I have never worn less than a decent department store suit so maybe I am blind to struggles of others, but even a $300 department store suit is quite comfortable. Nothing compared to 100% wool tailored pants that feel like amazing pajamas, but still comfortable compared to jeans.

text:Is anyone dressing up this year for Halloween?	labels:I usually go to my local goth club on Halloween, dress up ridiculously and dance all night. That is absolutely not happening this year, so I have opted to dress up ridiculously and drink for free at home.    2020 has been a complete wash as a year, but I haven't put on makeup or heels in 8 or 9 months. I'm hoping dusting off my vanity will cheer me up at least a little. Last year I wore a very involved angel costume, but since I'm not going out I'm just going to put on my much more comfortable bunny costume.
text:I completely agree with you. This has been the pits.  I WFH most of the time and I have started to get dressed up, make up, and a few times have even worn heels, to bring some normalcy in to the picture LOL  I also haven't seen many places pushing Halloween costumes and other gear like previous years. I bet they are all hurting too. Which really sucks.   Love that you are going to be in a comfy costume. I just found out that a few friends of mine are having a virtual Halloween party.

text:+J/UNIQLO SPECIAL COLLABORATION: What‚Äôs the verdict?	labels:I got the silk turtleneck is grey and black. I never see turtlenecks made of 100% silk so it intrigued me. The material is very thin as expected with silk so I skipped the white one. The standout of the silk knits would be the grey. The grey has a nice sheen to it and looks so luxe compared to a regular cotton turtleneck. They are so soft and warm and I can see myself wearing them for many years. I also got the double breasted wool coat in black. I had no intention of buying this but decided to try it on. I am a short gyal and this coat fit me so well I snatched it up right away. I was in the market for a new coat but was thinking of buying an Aritzia one but this one fit me much better. The thing I noticed with this coat is that the arms are cut in a way that it curves with the way that your arms fall on your body. It also has two inside pockets. I‚Äôm very impressed! I also tried the cashmere coats but I didn‚Äôt like those as much as I wanted something with a little more weight and more structured.

text:What materials are worth paying more for? What equals quality?	labels:Linen, silk, hemp, organic cotton, wool, cashmere. Natural is always better, generally speaking (excluding rayon/bamboo which is a natural derived synthetic, but including tencell which is eucalyptus.) And construction matters too, as does fabric weave. It‚Äôs so hard to judge quality online! I usually judge by touch and fabric hand and stitching quality. I have a degree in fashion design though so touch is the easiest way for me to identify a fabric! Personally I avoid nylon or polyester and consider it cheap. It is rarely high quality unless it is a high performance weave or treated, and even then it gets stinky easily. I only wear it for technical outdoor gear, like for hiking or swimming, for everyday wear, natural is always worth paying more!	episode_done:True
text:Noel Fielding X Fendi menswear colab	labels:I think Noel Fielding's art work is fun, and he is a very fun, odd dude. I loved him in IT Crowd, and he's weird as ever in the B. Baking series.   His Fendi graphics are arguably the better items in the fashion show, but wouldn't it be just as good if they used another contemporary artist? I feel that this type of graphics can be interchangeable. Any local graffiti artist could do something interesting. Noel is just famous.
text:You definitely have a point. While this collection leans more graffiti, I think the rest of his art is a bit more abstract than a lot of graffiti art I‚Äôve seen (though in fairness I don‚Äôt follow the graffiti scene closely), and the sweater vests and puffy coat showcase that for me. Maybe I‚Äôm just excited because I‚Äôve been eyeing some of his art prints and now his art is available in the form of fashion. I‚Äôm also very curious to see how they will translate the colab to RTW and if there will be additional prints that pop up there.	labels:	episode_done:True

Western wear aside, I feel like the subtext of the comment was basically ‚Äúif you‚Äôre not wearing something to fit in, you‚Äôre seeking attention.‚Äù Isn‚Äôt the pursuit of dressing better/more fashionably inherently attention seeking?

text:People who've been working from home for most of 2020 - do you think your work style will change when you go back to the office (compared to your work wardrobe pre-lockdown)? If so, how?	labels:I am a teacher that went back to working in the building at the beginning of September, so to be fair I was only wfh for several months in the spring, but it still drastically changed my style, or my perspective on my style.   Pre-Covid my work style (and general style) had morphed over the years to become very, very minimal and neutral. Lots of Everlane and Eileen Fisher. This was both because I wanted to be taken seriously at my job (I read very young) and because it also seemed like what was in style to me.   Returning to work in the fall, I realized I really f*cking hated all of my sensible, plain, go with everything black and grey clothes.   I still really prefer earth tones and blacks and greys, and I still wear some pretty simple outfits somedays, but I went on a small spree on The RealReal after I had my realization. I bought myself some louder statement pieces that feel more me, including an embroidered Happy Sheep sweater, a knit Missoni sheath dress, a multi-colored leather and fur purse, platform oxfords, and a couple of geometric patterned silk shirts and dresses.   For me life is too short to try so hard to be timeless and professional. I‚Äôm not knocking the look, it just isn‚Äôt ~me~ I want to love the clothes I wear and the clothes I love are fun knits and patterns.
text:I have kind of done this over the fall as well...  In the last few years I wore so much black- black shirts,  black leggings....every day.   Since I had to wear all black for work  the only nice things I bought for myself were black...  I just got so sick of it I started craving color. So I have kind of been on a spree but only for things with color, pattern, LIFE!  Life is too short to just live in neutrals	labels:	episode_done:True
text:I know ‚Äúfashion‚Äù but people of minorities are always forced to try better. Some Insights	labels:As a black man I'm not surprised by this at all. I don't think I'm as affected as most because my clothes are overtly fashionable and often feminine, and that tends to disarm any preconceptions of "dangerous" and "violent". But I see it all the time, and I do notice a difference on the rare occasions I just dress plainly. Before Covid, if I walked home from the gym at night in sweats I wouldn't put my hood up or my hands in my pockets because I walked by one of campus police's favorite sitting spots. We only need to look at Trayvon Martin for confirmation. One note about the study:  > While it is tempting to tell individuals that how they dress can evoke negative biases, this avoids addressing a bigger issue ‚Ä¶ In fact, directing individuals to change what they wear places the burden of mitigating stereotypes and associated prejudices on the wearer. Instead, we need to consider how we can change the perceptions of those who hold and use such stereotypes in harmful ways.  I agree and I appreciate the sentiment, but I'll be dead before we change racists' perceptions on this. It's not a burden I or any other black man should have to carry, but realistically it's a lot easier for me to change my clothes than for a racist to change their thinking.  ETA: Black women have it way worse. They get to have racism **and** misogyny!
text:I'm a PoC in Canada and even up here I notice how clothing changes perceptions but I had to go beyond fashionable to conservative business suits to notice it. I wore expensive trendy minimalist streetwear and still got followed in stores and stopped by the police in my own neighbourhood. Now that I wear suits on the daily, I notice how different you can be treated. I get smiles in the streets and less suspicion.

text:Same! LOL. I have basically only used the outerwear I need for my outdoor weightlifting class. And really none of my actual items have gotten much use.   But I did get a wool blend long coatigan from J. crew with an abstract leopard print in the fall. This was a big hit. It pills a little like most knits.

text:Rant - I'm fed up with fashion and "expressing myself"	labels:Have you thought about uniform dressing? I'm not talking about a boring black t-shirt and jeans every day. I wear a dress, sweater, and black pair of shoes every day. In the winder I add tights/leggings and an ankle book (summer is black sandals). I never have to think too much about what I wear and I don't really have to make any decisions after I purchase the item. My dresses are really comfortable, all of them have pockets, and I get compliments constantly. Uniform dressing sounds really boring, but you can create a fun and unique type of uniform if you want.  I tried a capsule wardrobe earlier this summer. It had dresses, shirts, pants and shorts, but I went back just dresses because the capsule was too many decisions. I just pick a dress that is clean and move on with my day, but I also still have a distinct and unique style.
text:Uniform dressing is the best!!  I have a VERY casual job (dog handler at a daycare) with an actual uniform (if very loose - t-shirts and hoodies with the logo) and it's lovely.  I don't have to think about it beyond checking the weather and seeing if I need two layers of fleece leggings and snow pants or if I need shorts and a wide-brimmed hat.  I now have a "uniform" for off days too.  Still super casual, but it's an easy selection.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:How do you handle budget increases when it comes to clothes? (ex. going from student to working professional)	labels:You Need A Budget. No, really - it's the best money-management app/process I've found. I signed up when I realized that I had promise to pay for a family Italian cruise because I had my first well-paying job - But I didn't seem to be getting ahead even though I was making twice as much as I had before. Zero-based budgeting in general is the way to go but I love YNAB for making that system easy to manage.  The thing that works for me about zero-based is that I can really easily prioritize the things that are important to me and also see the trade-off I'm making for every purchase if I change those priorities. It keeps those little windfalls or pay raises from just vanishing into the ether. I got paid $64 last week for a poshmark sale, and I immediately put that money in my March rent category. Before, I would have gone and bought a new shirt, or spent it all on soup dumplings, or bought a new shirt and then spilled the soup dumplings I also bought on the new shirt. üòÖ  If fashion is important to you, then you can prioritize that and invest in a wardrobe that will give you joy. If it's travel, put your money toward that instead, and you'll feel the power to walk away from a good sale because you know it's just a distraction from your real goals. I still spend a lot on clothes and eating out, but I no longer feel guilty or stressed about it, because when I spend it's a conscious choice.  I guess this is more general financial advice than specific to OP's situation, but I find it useful for any of us who have expensive hobbies (aka all of mine) or potential big expenses like OP's.	episode_done:True

text:What's Up With G By Guess?	labels:G by Guess, as you know it, is dead. Gone. The name will still exist, but it is basically a Guess Factory store. GBG has been struggling to perform well financially for a long time. The G by Guess design team does not exist anymore. Before COVID happened, Guess laid off the entire team, and the few designers/employees that survived were transferred to the Factory team. If you still want some quality, I suggest spending your money at the regular Guess stores. Their quality is still quite good in a lot of their clothing (accessories is a whole different story) and there is a dedicated Design team that still produces new collections every season. My source: I am close with several friends that have worked/are still working at the headquarter offices in Downtown Los Angeles.
text:Thank you so much for the insight. Yeah, the writing is on the wall. I know the brand was never popular since I always felt I was the only one buying their stuff. Sucks about the design team because the men‚Äôs stuff used to be good. Forever 21 had REALLY GOOD men‚Äôs stuff when the men‚Äôs line first debuted too, but they let go of a ton of designers too (many whom I heard were from GUESS).	labels:You‚Äôre welcome :) I actually met one of the Senior Designers working with the G by Guess team and he was actually really good. You can tell he was really creative and was able to design with the customer in mind. I do think that in the past few years they had a lot of limitations brought upon by upper management since the brand wasn‚Äôt performing as it used to. The brand, as a whole, is not what it used to be back in the days. Like F21, it‚Äôs days are long gone. Now, the company is only plagued by sexual allegations made against Paul Marciano, among other things. Not even their collaborations with J Balvin, JLO, etc. seem to do anything for them.
text:I think I‚Äôve heard of the allegations but yeah as a long-time fan, I could notice design quality dropping GREATLY. Even for the mainstake GUESS brand. It sucks, really. And GBG never really got its footing in the market because it came out at a time when F21 and H&M started expanding in the US. And when you compare prices, people would rather pay less. GBG did have some unique stuff 2010-2012 it seems because that‚Äôs when I bought the most stuff from the brand.	labels:You‚Äôre absolutely right. GBG did not have a chance standing against the Goliaths that were F21, Zara and H&M. Their price points were much higher, with similar, if not the same quality. They did have more design injected into their clothing, but unfortunately customers tend to favor price over design and quality. Glad to know you were able to at least experience GBG at its peak :)
text:I wonder where all these designers went off to when GUESS/GBG let them go. Yeah I hated seeing GBG lose its flair out of nowhere. All their later designs became very plain. I have no idea what they‚Äôre doin now merchandising-wise by filling GBG stores with GUESS Factory stuff. Might as we just close the GBG stores. I guess corporate is still figuring something out and they are filling stores with non-GBG stuff in the process.	labels:I think most of them just went off to F21, or other companies in the LA area. Even when a brand is not doing well, the name alone still has some value. They are probably trying to hold on to whatever the name ‚ÄúG by Guess‚Äù still has in value. If they were to give up the name, they can potentially loose trademark/copyright of that name and it becomes available for anyone else to pick up if they show Guess not using that name. I think it is honestly all legalities.
text:Interesting. I wonder what value they see if it‚Äôs so obvious they‚Äôve been on a decline for so long and ate scrubbing the name. It‚Äôd be odd to have the GBG sub-brand living under GUESS Factory forever. And it is sad the designers went on F21 because the stuff there (I am speaking for men) has declined so so much. When the men‚Äôs stuff came out in 2008, the designs and quality were SO good. Yes, it is fast fashion, but quality was so there. I bought F21 like crazy up till 2014 or so when quality started to slip. I met a guy who knew designers at F21 and said many from the initial Heritage 1981 men‚Äôs launch were pouched from GUESS (the irony).	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Distinct Fashion Phases	labels:Absolutely. I‚Äôve gotten much better at buying for what I‚Äôll actually wear vs aspiring to look like how the models (or influencers) look. I spent a fortune at Anthropologie from 2005-2010 and gorgeous dresses, most of which i never ended up wearing. I never really wore makeup.  From 2010-2012, I moved into Urban Outfitters basic-ness, trying to be a bit more edgy. This is when I started wearing winged liner every day.  From 2012-2016, I was all about Banana Republic, because of wanting to appear professional, but was so bored with my wardrobe. I toned down my liner but added neutral eye shadow.  From 2016-2018, I almost exclusively wore athleisure because of my work switching from business casual to casual. I was comfy af though. Minimal makeup all the way.  From 2018 on, I‚Äôve limited myself to second hand shopping. My look is much more eclectic now, but I find the items I buy feel more like treasures to me. I wear everything in my closet and I‚Äôve got a much more streamlined approach to shopping. If it‚Äôs not made of a natural material, I don‚Äôt buy it. If it‚Äôs not black, white, grey, blue, burgundy, or yellow, I don‚Äôt buy it. If a skirt isn‚Äôt an A-line silhouette, I don‚Äôt buy it. These hard stops have prevented me from making the same fashion mistakes over and over again. I‚Äôm a more efficient shopper and my wardrobe stays cohesive.   I‚Äôve definitely experienced a glow-up with makeup, though. I feel like I‚Äôve really nailed down the look I like and I wear it every single day - tinted moisturizer with SPF, neutral satin eyeshadow, winged liner, peachy blush, eyebrow pencil, and tinted chapstick. It takes me 5 min in total to do this look. I never get bored of it, either. When I have to do a presentation, I‚Äôll wear bold red lips and that adds enough variety for me to feel like I‚Äôve spiced it up.
text:I‚Äôm a huge fan of A- line skirts too. I find them quite flattering!   Same with red lips they are timeless and always a good move!	labels:	episode_done:True
text:what are your fashion flaws?	labels:Not planning what I am going to wear the night before plus not being a morning person, and then not utilizing my closet‚Äôs potential because I just pick out whatever is quickest while getting ready. So many beautiful clothes and outfits never worn!
text:Yep, I also have this same issue. I literally pick up whatever pants are strewn across the floor and then go grab a top that somewhat matches the bottoms. I also have this thing where in the evening, I imagine all these cool outfits that highlight my style and utilize all the shit I've bought trying to curate my wardrobe. However, when morning comes, I just want to be comfortable and wearing the leather mini-skirt with the 4" heeled booties I imagined the night before sounds unbearable. If I didn't have to adhere to at least a business casual dress code at work, I'd probably wear leggings and massive sweatshirts everyday.	labels:This is why I used to love packing for a business trip, because I'd plan every day's outfits (and throw in a few extra black things, because.)	episode_done:True
text:When/why did you get your first really fancy purse/bag?	labels:I got my first fancy bag after calling off my wedding lol I figured it cost around the same amount as the dress I wouldn‚Äôt ever wear so why not?

I just lost a ton of money on a wedding but I dodged a bullet and left that POS. All she said was ‚Äúwell you can always make more money‚Äù anyway, I‚Äôm getting a Chanel bag for my next milestone birthday. Not sure which one but it‚Äôs gonna happen soon.

text:Brands that no longer live up to their name or quality	labels:kind of all of them? It seems like you have to pay pretty steep prices now to get the quality of clothes that mid-price mall brands had in the 1990s and early 2000s. It seems that most stores have switched to a model of selling poor quality pieces at huge markups with the expectation that they will sell most of the stock at clearance prices. The GAP used to have quality staples, and J Crew was "fancy." Now GAP is really the same quality as Old Navy, and don't know what J Crew is anymore. The quality has certainly dropped, but I also don't get what is up with the designs since you can't even get a reasonable women's suit there these days. Madewell is not made well. Anthropologie used to sell unique pieces with really good construction, now it's roughly the same as other fast fashion, though I do appreciate that they added petite and plus sizing and carry some high end brands too. Levi's main line is terrible now, and to get the heritage quality, you need to get the Made and Crafted line, which is really expensive!  I mostly shop secondhand because I can't afford the stuff I like. When buying new, I try to wait for sales and avoid buying anything "final sale" or with complicated returns unless I know it will work. Clothes that I used to get at Anthropologie, I now get from Sezane, Ulla Johnson, Doen, and Samantha Pleet. I started buying vintage jeans over Madewell/Levi's or expensive craft brands‚Äîmy 1980s Chic and Gitano jeans were probably sold at K-Mart/Target but are better quality than anything I have gotten from Madewell. I don't wear jeans/denim enough to justify craft denim prices. Patagonia is still very high quality technical wear; I just scope out the Tyler sport outlet and secondhand for deals. Shoes are hard because I don't like to get them secondhand. I switched from Adidas to Veja and Diemme for sneakers (you can find Diemme shoes for huge markdowns on Yoox during the winter and summer sales‚ÄîI don't think they are worth retail price).
text:How is sezane quality for you? Do they hold up?   I love the aesthetic, but both times I tried ordering from them, I was so disappointed with the feel of the fabric and thought I wouldn‚Äôt want to pay more than Madewell prices for the quality.	labels:It really depends what you get. My Sezane silk pieces are high quality for the price, especially during the archives sale. My 100% merino wool sweater is also super soft, warm, and pretty‚Äîas soft as cashmere but warmer and without all the pilling. I don't like the jeans and would avoid the viscose and polyester pieces. The shoes are overpriced; I have a few pairs that I got secondhand but I won't be buying any more. I have some good Sezane dresses too but they aren't as consistently good as the blouses. One thing I quite like about Sezane is that returns are free and easy, even during Archives sale. The customer service has been good in my experience too‚Äîif there are issues with your order, you usually get credit notes or free gifts.  The best quality pieces have just really thoughtful details‚Äîbeautifully designed patterns, nice buttons, buttons up the back (so no gaping in front!), viscose (as opposed to polyester) linings, laces made out of cotton so they sit well and aren't itchy. It you like a tailored fit or have a very curvy body type the fit may not be idea. But I kind of like that tops are boxy/oversized because they fit my larger bust and shoulders, and I can just tuck them in for my preferred silhouette.  It's hard to describe how the pieces have held up over time because they are typically things I wear to work, and I haven't been to work in almost a year. I had one viscose dress that shrank, so I swore off the viscose! My silk shirts have done great with just hand washing. I have a wool coat that I got secondhand that has gotten very pilly, but I think that's just the fabric. I have had it for years, and there are no tears in the lining or loose buttons or misshapenness (issues I have had with many winter coats before). The linen is a little on the rougher side, but my linen pieces have kept their shape and the color didn't bleed with hand washing. I also have a secondhand pink cotton blouse that I put through the washing machine all the time and it still looks great.	episode_done:True

text:Shitpost Saturday: Fashion Resolutions	labels:Now that we're in week 579 of quarantine, I've forgotten what day of the week it is, which is... not great.  The solution is obvious: Day of the Week Underwear!  This will ensure that not only do I always know what day of the week it is, but I'll also go back to changing my underwear daily.   I also have resolved to only thrift my clothing, so I bought a used pack of day of the week underwear on ebay. It's missing Wednesday, but Wednesday is the worst day of the week anyway, so I'm just going to skip Wednesdays and go straight to Thursdays. Then, every two months, I'll have a leap week, where I don't wear any underwear at all, so that I can "reset" to the proper days of the week.   A flawless plan!
text:I have news for you, it's against eBay rules to sell used underwear, so the pack you bought must've gotten through the filters, and... may not have been intended for actual wearing üò±   10/10 plan otherwise!!!	labels:	episode_done:True

Study basics of color theory and look at the world around you. There is also shape, proportion of colors that can and will change color interaction, so these sorts of guides aren't fool proof either anyway. If you are interested in dressing better, learning the basics of design and color theory is worth it. Learn how to fish, sort of thing.	episode_done:True

And by all, I mean *ALL*. There‚Äôs no variance, no personality in any of your echo chamber outfits. My friends and I used to dress like this 10 years ago anyways.

Outfits always cute, but accessible/not over the top

text:Hats - discussion	labels:I don't know anything about "hat energy" but I know that hats, like hair, look best when they're shaped, colored, and styled in a way that suits your face and outfit.  The bolder the hat, the more obvious it may be if you don't know what you're doing, but even with a more understated hat, a clumsy choice is going to be pretty obvious.  I mean, it's *on top of your head.*  I wear a lot of hats and I've been told I wear them well, but I dress in vintage style so I have outfits that are made to be worn with hats, a pretty good frame of reference in terms which hats to wear with which outfits.  More recent maintstream fashion is really not styled to be worn with hats, so fitting a hat in there requires a bit of crafty innovation, and it probably requires reducing your range of hats to the most basic casuals; floppy sunhats, berets, cabbies, beanies and baseball caps.  Each of those styles has an existing set of visual conventions:  While you don't necessarily *need* the whole tweed jacket and oxford shoe getup to pull off a cabbie, for example, taking some queues from that genre of style will help contextualize the cabbie in a way that makes it less jarring to look at.	episode_done:True
text:Black is Beautiful, Braids are Beautiful, Bald is Beautiful: Ayanna Pressley as an icon of feminine professionalism	labels:I think people just now are starting to really see the beauty in blackness, not just in fashion sense, which has always been apparent, but also in human terms.  I mean, black people or people of black skin color have been painted in very ugly and negative terms for hundreds if not thousands of years.  And that has been done by people of light skin color.  I have not seen a lot of examples of people of dark skin color vilifying people of white skin color, just based on their skin color alone.    This stuff has been around for thousands of years.  I think it really started with the Romans and the great lie they have perpetrated to steal the identity of Christ, because they could not contain the spread of Christianity despite the persecution of Christians after Christ's death.    The color black in fashion has always been wildly successful.  However, that success has never translated to black people or people of black skin color because of the concerted effort that has been done throughout millenia against them.  Black beauty is a light within which had been hidden from the world.  Despite efforts to reverse this coming to light, or as I would call it Black Enlightment, it is undeniable that this trend too is unstoppable.  Justice for All...	episode_done:True

text:Bodysuits better than skims (important)	labels:I have never worn a contour bodysuit and I am interested! Is this purely shapewear or can you wear it as an actual garment? How do you style it?
text:Contour is just the name of the bodysuit line from the brand! It‚Äôs more of just an actual garment instead of shape wear since the material is not as super stretch but it is definitely very slimming and hugging. I typically wear it as an easy basic top, it can be dressed up with a nice pair of high waist pants, heels, and mid length coat. I‚Äôll dress is down with slim sweats and a long sleeve crew bodysuit and white sneakers just to look cozy comfy but still decently put together	labels:Aaah I get you! I thought they were like special shapewear bodysuits haha. They look fantastic though so I'm glad to have the recommendation - a great basic layer like this always makes a difference!	episode_done:True

So I would say buy the thing you want to try, try it on at home and if it doesn‚Äôt work out just take it back to the store.

text:Inspo Album: Pulling the Past Forward, Asian-style	labels:Why call it a BIPOC album if it is just Asian people. Call it Asian diaspora.
text:I don't think OP is wrong to call it a BIPOC album. After all, Asians are a part of BIPOC. Let's not be exclusionary with the term. Just because I'm Asian (and only Asian) does not mean I can't or shouldn't refer to myself as BIPOC. Just because it's a Black Live Matter protest doesn't mean it shouldn't be referred to as BIPOC. If anything, I think important that all the minorities are able to find solidarity and support in the term and the movement.	labels:I think it is important to use the right term when being specific. People of color are not interchangeable. There is a time to use a term for everyone and a time to be specific. This is a specific album and that is fine. That doesn‚Äôt mean Asian are excluded from BIPOC.   I personally feel erased as this BIPOC album is only Asian (East and Southeast Asian). I assume that when something is called BIPOC there are a variety of people of color represented from Black to Asian to Latinx to Indigenous. That is not the case here.   POC started as a term to encompass Black women and involved to refer to all non-white people. And eventually people started using it when they specifically meant Black people, making it seem if everyone had the same experience. And now it is full circle and there is a whole new term to call out the people that got more erased.	episode_done:True
text:I bought these very popular aritzia melina leather pants..an inspo album and fit pictures	labels:The fit from the knee down does not do the pants or you any favors :/ the way it sits on the top of your foot makes all the outfits feel dated instead of trendy.

text:Buying vs selling on resell websites	labels:I bought/sold on Poshmark when it was starting to get popular, and found great deals and sold pretty easily on it. I stopped a year later - by that time, I had started seeing wholesale distributers flooding the site and making it alot harder for me to find actual used clothing for decent prices. I'd agree that there are likely too many sellers now compared to buyers - or at least too much merchandise compared to buyers. To me, that makes Poshmark too much like Ebay, and is no longer as distinct a platform as it used to be.  Edit: typos
text:I've got some great deals as a buyer and now I'm dipping into selling, just to get rid of some old stuff without having to dump it at a thrift store where I know it will probably be thrown away.   The wholesalers have ruined the site, I feel like it's impossible to discover new brands, since if you don't type in a specific brand the results are almost all shitty wholesalers selling crap.   Ha there is wayyyy too much merchandise on both of those sites, I might never have to buy new clothing ever again!

I have two: one sleek with minimal hardware and the other perfecto style with a belt. I like to wear them over girly dresses or a skirt/sweater combo, and wear sneakers or ballet flats to soften the look a bit more. Never with boots or jeans as I feel I‚Äôm not cool enough to pull that off, haha.	episode_done:True

text:I'm Not a Watch Guy I Swear - Street x Sprezza	labels:I am a watch guy, but very much a relatively broke one.  Had I known how much trouble it would be to break into watches, I might have said never mind and wisely walked away. I didn‚Äôt, though.   Some pointers for those interested:  1.	The cost of the watch is only the upfront cost. Like a car, a mechanical watch needs regular maintenance. Generally speaking, this will be anywhere from $300 to $1,000+...every 5-7 years.  2.	Because of point #1, entry level (~ $500) mechanical watches are not pieces you will pass down to your kids. In fact, it is usually cheaper to trash them entirely and buy new than to bother having them serviced.  3.	People will tell you there are deals to be had in the vintage market. That‚Äôs true, but it can also be difficult to find parts or people willing to work on them. 4.	There is relatively little offered between entry level and about $3,000.  5.	There is nothing wrong with wearing a quartz or digital watch.   All that being said, I still love my small collection. Just wish I had known those things from the start.
text:hard disagree with point #4. See: Nomos, Sinn, Seiko, Grand Seiko quartz, Damasko, etc.	labels:I'm a former watch guy. I guess the hard part is for most who arent watch geeks, they'd want public recognition after spending $2-3k on wrist candy and the public dont know Nomos, Sinn, Marathon, Baltic, Oris. They know Seiko as the brand their grade school math teacher wore.

text:Does anyone have a "uniform"?	labels:This sub celebrates all sorts of fashion but not everyone is up for endless variety. If this is something you‚Äôre keen about, you should go for it. But slowly - make sure that the multiple versions of one outfit is something you really love wearing and won‚Äôt get bored of before you buy more  If this is more like an area you are exploring due to frustration of having nothing to wear, consider a capsule wardrobe instead. It‚Äôs much more involved and intentional than coming up with a uniform but it is a little more flexible	episode_done:True
text:It‚Äôs 2021. A vaccine for the virus has been made widely available and businesses may operate at full capacity, including bars, clubs, salons, etc. How will this influence fashion?	labels:People will go ALL OUT. This sub usually salivates at the thought of athleisure taking over and killing fashion (and fast fashion) but that 100% wouldn't happen. Almost every woman I know is bloody sick and tired of not getting to dress up, not being able to wear lipstick, not having places to wear heels and vacation outfits. People would literally go crazy and it truly would be the roaring twenties. Dresses of all types, miniskirts, sparkle and glitter, heels for days, fun fabrics, bolder colors, leather pants, blouses with impractical sleeves, statement earrings ‚Äì women would really be dressing to the nines *and* wearing bold lipstick colors to compliment.
text:The other day I had to go run an errand and it was a little too chilly to wear my house clothes out. So I put on jeans and a long sleeve shirt and for the first time in a long time I felt like a goddamn person. Some days during this pandemic I have been playing dressup for fun, but it's not the same as going out. I can't wait to go out and dress up again.  A couple times during this pandemic, I fell into this habit of buying clothes and accessories to wear "when things get back to normal". I think it helps me better picture things going back to normal, and I look forward to wearing the new stuff. I mean, if life is just gonna be like this forever, why do I own this cute new backpack, or this tea dress with petticoat?! CHECKMATE, UNIVERSE	labels:	episode_done:True

text:What age did you start pinning down your style? And how many times has it changed since then?	labels:I experimented with a lot of different styles over the years but I think I really settled into my style at around 23 years old. I‚Äôm 28 now and still dress the same, which may not seem that long but before I was changing pretty dramatically on a yearly basis. I think it just came with age and getting to know myself better. Before I was always chasing trends and trying to dress for others, but as of 23 I started to dress for myself and stopped caring if something was in fashion or not. It led me to discovering pieces and styles that I really loved, that also suit my lifestyle, which hasn‚Äôt changed too much over the years (living in a big city and working at an office that allows for casual dress).	episode_done:True
text:Shitpost Saturday: Body Types (no fruit answers allowed)	labels:Ok, true story. My boyfriend‚Äôs daughter and I were talking about body types, and how I‚Äôm a pear. He overhears and disagrees vehemently.   He‚Äôs a quick-thinking guy, and I know he‚Äôll have a good answer, so I say, ‚Äúok smart guy, what shape am I?‚Äù  ‚ÄúWell, you‚Äôve got good hips and butt, and a long but slender torso. You‚Äôre male genitalia. Penis and balls.‚Äù  So, apparently I‚Äôm genitalia shaped. Sorry, that‚Äôs not a food, but it‚Äôs what I‚Äôve got.

text:Let's talk the impact of fragrance on perception of style! How much does a person's fragrance affect your impression of them? Do you choose perfume with this in mind? What are some of your favourites?	labels:I definitely base my choice of the perfume I‚Äôm going to wear during the day on my mood/what I‚Äôm doing that day. I wear mainly Hermes perfumes only (because they don‚Äôt give me a migraine like a lot of other perfumes do), and I rotate between them based on how I feel and would like to be perceived if someone catches a whiff of my perfume as I walk by. I also have been in a situation where someone I‚Äôm talking to seems genuinely nice, etc but has horrendous perfume on. I can‚Äôt focus on anything else but the bad scent when this happens.	episode_done:True
text:Stockings vs Tights vs Leggings	labels:I wore skirts and dresses most days during the previous fall and winter seasons. My go-to stockings/tights were opaque Uniqlo Heat Tech. I‚Äôd pair them with an ankle or knee high boot. If I was wearing knee high boots I could also wear thick knee high socks.   I will say, I‚Äôm very used to wearing skirts and dresses no matter the temperature. Plus I overheat quickly once I get indoors if I layer too much.	episode_done:True

text:The Style Blogger Index: finding people who are the same size as you	labels:I found none that even resembled me, and I have a conventional type body. Even those who seemed slightly like me, had obviously not told the truth about their measurements
text:I'm so sorry. The database is still very small  (under 600) and the app is only representative of a few hundred (it needs an update, and even then can only represent those who entered 100% of the data without exceptions -- limitations in the programming until I can actually get a web developer.) Please let me know if there's anything you think I can do to improve this, including giving more explicit instructions to participants. The survey does provide measuring instructions, but self reporting does have its limitations and there are always going to be inconsistencies. But I am very open to suggestions for improvement! Even if it's not currently feasible, maybe it will be one day if I ever get funding (the dream, right?)	labels:This is a really neat tool! I didn't find a good size twin for myself but it is awesome to be able to search like this. I think if you added some measurements other than bust/waist/hip and height, it might help account for different body composition.
text:I was thinking about creating a sewists index with additional measurements! The trouble with adding new variables now is that I would have to manually go back and contact each individual participant (and i don't have they're email address since the survey would have to display them publicly) to get that info retroactively. But i could add them in as optional metrics for future users. Or volunteers could help me contact existing entrants but I'm not holding my breath :D	labels:	episode_done:True
text:General Discussion - January 19, 2021	labels:I never thought I'd become this person, but man, shipping costs really can fuck up my desire to buy something. I was just about to commit to buying another pair of sneakers and it's probably the best deal I'm going to find on them, added to cart, shipping info entered, billing info entered... $20 for the cheapest shipping option. No shipping codes available, no threshold I can cross to get free shipping. $20 period, no exceptions.  It's a $300 pair of sneakers discounted to $180, I guess should be able to rationalize that at $200 (including shipping), I'm still getting a better deal than what's available anywhere else online (only a few select retailers got this colorway, and all but one are sold out in my size), but still, $20 shipping feels *wrong*. My brain has been trained from years of online shopping that there should always be some way to get around paying for shipping, or otherwise, shipping should be cheap.
text:My unpopular opinion : most shipping is criminally underpriced and we should pay more for it. Many of the externalities don't seem to be priced in properly and everyone ends up paying for me to have my luxury purchases delivered.	labels:Actually worming in shipping has caused me to drastically reconsider how I view shipping costs online, it‚Äôs not as cheap as people would like it to actually be.   It also makes it really frustrating to have customers come into our store and get upset with shipping cost because they assume they‚Äôd be paying the same price as what Amazon charges them	episode_done:True
text:Thoughts on ski / apres ski style?	labels:A word of caution: My aunt (an experienced skier) wore a fashinonable all white outfit skiing one day in the 70s. She went down a trail the wrong way and got lost. It took hours for the ski patrol to find her because it was hard to see her against the snow. She thought at one point she was going to have to spend the night on the mountain which might have killed her.    Don't wear all white while skiing.

text:How does a warm weather wardrobe differ from a cold weather wardrobe?	labels:Having a heavier coat on hand isn‚Äôt a bad idea, especially if it‚Äôs already available - but for context I grew up in Austin, TX and the *only* winter coat I ever had I purchased specifically for a vacation. There‚Äôs an odd day every couple of years where you might want to use it... but for the most part people just stay inside and the weather warms up.  Things like a lighter fleece will take care of you pretty well on the coldest typical winter days.   A big thing I would recommend is a lot of light layers that are easily removed - cardigans, button ups, jean jackets, whatever. They served me well year round, even on the hottest days. I‚Äôm not sure specifically about New Orleans, but it‚Äôs pretty common to run the air conditioning really intensely in that part of the country (I swear my high school was kept at 50 degrees year round) and being able to cover my arms indoors was important to my comfort. Basically just something that‚Äôs light and easy to store away when you‚Äôre in the heat.	episode_done:True

text:Do you feel constrained fashion-wise by not wanting to (or being able to) wear heels?	labels:I recently lived in Paris near some of the the biggest tourist attractions, and I would spot Instagram influencers daily. I‚Äôd say I‚Äôd see them change into heels about half the time. Some folks just commit, but it always stood out as unusual. Paris is not stiletto friendly. Although it‚Äôs seen as a formal city, compared to any American metropolis, footwear is casual and out wear is practical. That being said, a 2-3 inch heeled boot or bootie was not uncommon and along with sneakers, the norm.   My most memorable influencer sighting was a very glamorous woman in a tiny yellow dress and heels on a 40 degree (Fahrenheit) day taking pictures on a windy terrace, only to see her minutes later coming out of a public restroom in weather appropriate and casual attire.   I feel like this stuff is dependent on your own lifestyle, and the context of the city. My own comfort level with heels has changed significantly over the past decade, from wearing a heel everywhere, everyday to now owning one pair for parties.  As for non-heeled influencers: there are so many! What kind of style do you gravitative towards?

text:How different is your actual heel length vs what it's advertised as and, how much does it change by shoe size for you?	labels:If the heel height is graded for size the angle of the footbed should remain constant between sizes.   IME wearer weight, fitness, and tolerance for discomfort play a more significant role than anything else. I‚Äôm 176cm, IT38, wear heels more than is probably good for me, and can comfortably manage a 100-105mm pump sans platform to dinner, and 85mm or so for days at the office if needed. With an enclosed wedge or block heel style I can easily do ten miles of walking at the same height, more with alcohol ;) I‚Äôm a former rock climber and lifelong endurance athlete, so discomfort and chafing are not foreign to me. Even the worst heel is much more comfortable than trying to jam a thin crack! I have former dancer friends who report a similar experience, while other less grin-and-bear-it types find anything more constrictive than Uggs unbearable.   I drop weight in the late summer and early fall for races, and even the 2-3kg shift makes a huge difference in comfort.	episode_done:True
text:Adapting to age/workplace appropriate attire while staying true to yourself [discussion]	labels:I still buy from the junior's section and I'm 31. A) I'm only 5'2" and B) it's sometimes cheaper. I just try to make sure that I don't wear something to work that my students would wear. Beyond that, the sky's the limit. I'm known for dressing up anyway.  Look for sturdier materials rather than "slub" ones, and pay close attention to fit. I look better in form-fitting clothes or items with a defined waist, and avoid the long and loose T-shirt dresses. If material and fit are good, I find that nobody can really tell that it's a dress designed for twelve year-olds.	episode_done:True
text:Creative pragmatism light	labels:I follow her too and am interested in the answers. I love the way she styles herself because she looks effortlessly cool to my eyes. The clothes mostly wouldn‚Äòt work for me because I‚Äòm only 5‚Äò1, so lots of things are too big. Anything ‚Äöoversized‚Äò just makes me look a little childish. I still try to incorporate some of her tips. There are brands like COS that do similar things with cool shapes and ‚Äödifferent‚Äò basics.  ETA: Do you like the pieces themselves or her style philosophy? Because occasionally I think the clothes she presents are.. pretty ugly, tbh
text:I am whole 5'4 but I love oversize, especially now having workliveexisted at home for so many months, I cannot bother with uncomfortable clothes. I even started to look into men's section for interesting prints and roomy clothes. I love Amy's tips on how to look comfortable on different occasions but still put together, not sloppy.   Now when you asked, I think I really love the philosophy even more than clothes themselves. I love the suits, the knits, some of the tops. However I absolutely cannot wear the shoes, neither a sandal nor an "ironic" furry shoe because of practicality, dress code, weather. So yes, I think I am really looking for brands who share similar philosophy of creative basics.	labels:I agree, her tips on looking put together but still stylish and chic are great!

Even worse, what if I babied them and stressed about keeping them pristine and STILL couldn‚Äôt sell them later on?  In the past when I‚Äôve gotten lucky with recouping costs on items sold, it‚Äôs always been an unexpected surprise and on random contemporary brands like Aritzia and LL Bean (??). Meanwhile my HE stuff seems to park forever.
text:Are you consigning HE stuff? I don‚Äôt trust it on resale sites (looking at you Poshmark) because so many have trash authentication services.

It used to be semi trendy on this sub a few years ago and I loved browsing through peoples wardrobes. I thought maybe it would come back with the YouTube trend "trying everything on in my closet" but no :(  Anyways, it's crazy to see how different shaped every t-shirt is considering they are all so the same. Different length and size sleeves plus waist cutting and its easy understand why people have so many of the same thing
text:ooh boy I was thinking about posting, asking for help, since I'm doing a no buy this year and still have WAY too many things and no one IRL can come over and tell me what looks good or not...

text:The Very Useful Black Sweater	labels:>And black leathers don‚Äôt acquire the  patina that makes a pair of well-polished, well-worn brown leather  shoes so handsome. In fact, giving up square-toed black shoes in favor  of more anatomically correct brown ones became something of a rite of  passage for well-dressed men.   This is quite a reach. But then again it does feel quite reminiscent of nearly MFA where brown red wings were the best choice a man could make.

text:Marilyn Monroe: Casual Style and Dressing for Men	labels:This is a place for discussion, so.. In my opinion, true womanhood is not tied to certain behaviors. What would those behaviors be, do you mean? How can you behave in a way that makes you less of a woman?  Being womanly isn't tied to wanting to doll up for men. Are you also saying that women that don't feel like they have to doll up in front of 10000 marines are lesser women because of it?   In my opinion, all of this is based on sexist views that once again, men are the true judges of what's sexy, what's a true woman, and what a woman should dress like and act like in order to be a real woman. You say this, but with different words, when you describe how men appreciate something that's more true than what women appreciate.  Can't we just appreciate fashion and clothes without having to *be* something?   Marilyn Monroe grew up in a man's world. 2020 is *supposed* to be 50/50.

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - January 15, 2021	labels:A question about cotton/modal blend undershirts:  I used to buy the **Hanes** Comfort Fit Ultra Soft Cotton/Modal undershirts, and they were OK.  A little while ago, I picked up a few **Goodfellow** brand cotton/modal/spandex blend undershirts from Target on a whim, and they were much better than the ones from Hanes. Softer feel, but still thick enough to wear around the house, and longer than the Hanes shirts so they stay tucked in better. My only complaint was that the V-neck wasn't very deep, so it would often show when I left the top button of my shirt unbuttoned. I can't really wear them with casual and camp collar shirts.  Recently I haven't been able to find the Goodfellow modal-blend undershirts at Target (only 100% cotton), but I'm reluctant to go back to the Hanes ones now that I've tasted this luxury.  I've looked at the **David Archy** modal undershirts, because I have some of their boxer briefs and find them very comfortable, but they are a 92% Modal, 8% Spandex blend and the reviews suggest they leave nothing to the imagination.  I'm also looking the **Uniqlo** "Dry" V-neck short-sleeve shirts. However I already have two Uniqlo "Airism" undershirts, and they are so thin they are nearly sheer. I don't really feel comfortable wearing them without another layer.  Are there any other cotton/modal (or similar) blend shirts that you'd recommend? My personal preferences are:  * Ideally less than $10 each * Soft and moisture-wicking fabric, not 100% cotton * V-neck deep enough to leave one button open without the undershirt being visible * Not too thin and revealing  Thanks!	episode_done:True

text:What are your favorite, trusted clothing lines for buying wear-forever investment classics?	labels:For cashmere specifically, you should try Pringle of Scotland, Johnston of Elgin, and Agnona on resell sites. They are top tier cashmere brands but not " well known" like Brunello Cuccinelli or Loro Piana. Brora is also very good quality but their styles can be a little "JC Penny" or "Kohls‚Äù catalog. I don't know how you describe it, but yeah.  Otherwise, what immediately came to mind for me is Adam Lippes. It's insanely expensive, up there with your ‚Äúfashion house designers‚Äù but unlike those, it's not super well known and not an "it-brand" so there's not a lot of fakes floating around. I thrift it off of Ebay, the RealReal, and occasionally discount sites and never worry about authenticating it the way I would for say, Chanel, Dior, Gucci, Prada etc. I'm no stranger to designer goods but their material and construction is absolutely amazing. Like the highest quality, weightiest fabric you can imagine. Honestly you could wear their shirts inside out because the hems are finished so perfectly, it'd be hard to tell.   Another one that I love that I NEVER hear of is Petar Petrov. What that brand does with silk is frankly incredible. The colors and cuts (especially their very flattering body skimming bias cuts) are stunning in person and nothing like any kind other designer I‚Äôve ever seen. Again pricey pricey, but not popular/not high in demand so a diligent online shopper could thrift it more easily.  Sometimes even with truly luxury designer, I feel like the consumer is paying for the logo-bling, design and but necessarily quality. But these two luxury brands are IMO consistently both design and quality and no visible logos.

text:For many people on this sub fashion is a hobby, and so they don't mind spending a bit more on quality items. Some materials (e.g. wool/ leather) are just more expensive.  There's also the question of quality. A 500‚Ç¨ leather jacket may be usable for 20 years, while a 100‚Ç¨ one will deteriorate after 2.   The reality is though, people on this sub rarely pay full price for their items. Many buy during store discounts or second hand.

text:Does anyone have a "uniform"?	labels:I often buy multiples of items I love. I bought several of the same cardigan after I realized that I wore it more than any other sweater I owned. It's great!  Another thing I do is, when I see an item I like, I mentally run through my closet and see if it will mesh with what I already own. If it works, I get it. If I'd have to buy several new items to make it work, I don't. For this reason, I don't own many t-shirts, but I do own lots of sweaters and dresses.
text:That‚Äôs the biggest life lesson I‚Äôve carried on from one of my high school teachers - if you find you truly love an item of clothing, it‚Äôs worth the time to go back and get it in every color (that‚Äôll fit your wardrobe).

text:What are people's experiences with clothing challenges like trying not to buy clothes for a year/only buying second hand? What are some tips?	labels:I think it‚Äôs important to buy things that you really LOVE. A lot of the time we feel the need to shop because we‚Äôre bored of our closets and feel like something is missing.  I love leather jackets and used to buy a lot of them in every color and finish. They were all nice and cute, but was never really in love with any of them. Maybe the leather was kind of thin. Maybe they didn‚Äôt have zippers in every place I wanted. Maybe they didn‚Äôt fit me quite perfectly. So I decided to treat myself to an expensive designer jacket and that I was OBSESSED with. And I haven‚Äôt felt the need to buy another leather jacket since.  I‚Äôm not saying you have to buy designer or anything like that, but buying more peices you love and are obsessed with will help you ‚Äúshop your closet‚Äù every day and help curb some of your need to spend.	episode_done:True
text:How do you know when something doesn't fit perfectly?	labels:I'm 5"4, which means regular suit skirts and work dresses are a bit long but petite alternatives are a bit short, so I get the lengths hemmed. Ditto with my suit jackets and wool coats, if feasible.	episode_done:True

text:How do you shop in COVID?	labels:I moved to a big city in 2012 and driving and parking is miserable, so I have been online shopping for years now.  I use Zappos and Amazon a lot. For Zappos returns, you print a label, tape it up and take to any UPS place. I have a very difficult time buying shoes, so I might order a dozen pair and sometimes return them all. If the business wants to do this, I am cooperative.  You have to check on Amazon before you purchase and make certain it's returnable. UPS will box it up for you, it's amazing.  I hear Kohl's does also, but I never go there. You can print your own label and return it to an Amazon locker, that's even easier than a UPS store.  I check my measurements carefully and read a lot of reviews. I don't actually return much that I buy except for shoes.  I buy everything online, but bras? I don't know, that might be difficult.	episode_done:True

text:Thank you! Textures is one of the things I struggled with for the longest time, I think the thing that helped me the most was jut going for the dumb statement pieces (velvet blazer, the skirt that has a ton of different textures in itself, lace) rather than buying the same mostly cotton/jersey basics.  Cozy fits are my favourites :)  I have a bunch of cool rings, so when I‚Äôm in the mood I‚Äôll just put all of them on. But I don‚Äôt really see them as part of the outfit since I‚Äôm not picking them specifically based on what I‚Äôm wearing, if that makes sense? I wish I was more of a jewellery person, but the stuff I like is a bit expensive and I‚Äôd rather spend that money on clothes, and I‚Äôm also so lazy in putting it on.

Really think about what goes with the rest of your wardrobe, and buy things that you would want to wear again and again.  I buy fast fashion, but I have a very small closet. I don't consider my fast fashion items disposable. They are treated with similar care as I would treat the more expensive pieces in my wardrobe, like Max Mara, etc.  I also purchases second hand a lot of the time, and often consider trend cycles when I buy items. I avoid the really trendy stuff - unless it's something I really want to try out, and buy things that wouldn't feel that outdated in 3 years time.  In the case of buying 2 dollar tees and really cheap shoes - it might not be sustainable in the long run, because based on my experience, bad quality tees don't last very long.

text:Pros and cons of an a capsule wardrobe?	labels:Disclaimer-- I know myself well enough to know that a capsule wardrobe is not for me.  When I get back from traveling, I cannot wait to wear different clothes.  Consider your laundry situation.  Having a smaller wardrobe means that you will be doing laundry more often.  If you're one in a family of 6, it may not be a big deal.  But for a single apartment dweller (pay per load), the additional costs can add up quickly.   Because I pay per load, I make sure that I maximize the capacity and only wash full loads (I'm paying the same no matter the capacity).  I am not one to hand-wash clothes in a bathroom sink.  Not now, not ever!   I do laundry roughly every other week alternating lights and darks.  (Sheets and towels are their own ballgame, and I will sometimes throw things in with them.)
text:Just curious but why didn't you get a washing machine for the apartment?	labels:Some condos either don't have space or they don't have the right connections. I do wonder if some rental apartments mandate coin laundry.
text:It's weird to control what appliances go into places you rent out in my opinion.  I only want to know what conditions lead to her not owning one because it is common where I'm from even in the cheapest type... People are so overly sensitive here they downvote anything that has the slightest possibility of being offensive	labels:Landlords' prerogative, their property, their say. I actually want to understand why too, because I consider a washer and dryer to be basic appliances. IMO some rental places have coin laundry maybe so landlord can make some more $$$ or something.   Other times, for older buildings, maybe the infrastructure just isn't there and it's pretty infeasible to make such radical changes.
text:I'm a landlord, I own a condo in an apartment style building. I looked at getting a washer and dryer in my unit, but there wasn't the proper venting for the dryer in place. It was an issue with the building that wasn't possible to change from my unit. So as you mentioned, an infrastructure issue. I'm happy though at least that the use of the laundry facilities in the building is free for my tenants to use.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:How did you curate/purge your wardrobe specifically for moving? What pieces did you bring when moving to a drastically different climate? What other fashion moving tips do people have?	labels:I have moved to different climates many times. My recommendation would to not purge or change anything until your move is complete. The reason is, you definitely get climatized, where what would consider "warm" in the winter to you now will feel chilly enough to wear heavyweight items you hadn't expected would work once you are climatized. A lot of items that you think will/won't work end up being the opposite, etc. You mentioned having less storage, so it sounds like you will need to offload/purge at some point, but I'd wait to do it once you get there and put it off for as long as you can to truly see what items work. I'll never move to a cold climate again but even moving to different warmer climates, I will wait to do any paring down/purging until I can get a little climatized and adapt.
text:Was coming here to say this as well. I recently moved from the Midwest to Florida and my body adjusted pretty quickly to the higher temps here. It‚Äôs my first winter and I find myself still wearing my warmest wool and cashmere sweaters, winter coat, and gloves. It‚Äôs all relative, so a 30F degree drop day to day is going to feel cold regardless of if you started at 90F or 60F. I would also recommend trying to wait a year if you can before purging. I think I could safely purge my snow pants if I wasn‚Äôt planning on using them when I visit my parents. It‚Äôs also hotter longer here though, so I could definitely reduce my sweaters by 20% (the ones I reach for last anyway) to make room for more hot weather clothing. Hope this helps and good luck with your move!	labels:In regards to the snow pants: I personally would definitely find a way to store stuff like that if you like to travel or visit family. I have always lived in southeastern Texas but my husband and I tend to be able to travel when it is winter up north and I *definitely* have super cold weather (for me) items I only break out when I travel. Even though they only get used once a year or less, it is worth it to have for me.	episode_done:True

text:Lower quality items during Nordstrom Anniversary Sale?	labels:I realized this during black friday sales a few years ago.  I think all retailers do it.  Brands create special products for "X Retailer Only" with a discounted price which is really just a lower quality item but passed off to the customer as if it's a great deal.  I'm done with big sales.
text:I don't shop any big sales anymore either.  I still like a good "outlet style" pop up shop, where they rent an empty storefront and sell directly from the shipping boxes.  But I admit that I may go to those in large part for the experience.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Does the way you dress really have to have a label for it??	labels:No, no, no and no. I hate the aesthetic thing. Buying things bc 'they fit in with my aesthetic' and not bc you like them is weird to me. You can be all of those styles all at once. I love having a grungy girl moment, a colourful LOOKATMENOW moment, a classy neutral I'm a big girl moment and a floaty yes I am a fairy and I just tiptoe about in pretty midi dresses moment.
text:However, some guide in the side bar helped me realise, that I also don't need to love every piece I own. Some basics help to bring attention to my favourites. So for me it is about balance, I guess? Wouldn't buy anything I can't personally tolerate tho.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Where do you find inspiration for your Outfits?	labels:I follow small stores and artists on Instagram that take my breath away. It's sort of a double-edged sword because then I feel like there are more things I would like to have, but it definitely has helped me feel more decisive about what outfits I feel comfortable and happy in.   I also get inspired by colors in nature, like in certain panoramas or animals, and from music that I like. I love Sufjan Stevens' music, in a phrase it's "cozy storyteller" for me and that has definitely influenced my style.	episode_done:True

text:FR. ive been enjoying old games recently. Its a total win  -games are cheap, save $$  -my out of date computer is more than enough to run them just fine, save $$  -history has curated the best games, so no need to gamble on something that might not be fun, saves time and $$  -maybe connected to the survivor bias mentioned above, it feels like older games relied more on story telling than mechanics and graphics. Also there are definitely modern games (especially big budget) which are designed to retain the player base and suck out the $$. Planned addiction is just a sour taste that leaves me feeling more vacant than I started (to quote that social dilemma doc.)	labels:The trick is to only play games from at least five years ago.  Bugs are fixed, popular opinion is settled, they cost like a tenner and run on any semi modern laptop.  Basically doing the cultural history of video games on a five year delay.	episode_done:True
text:Schott 538 Nubuck Cowhide Mechanic Jacket	labels:Schott jackets are designed for old white people. You can get this style in a more flattering cut from Aero for around the same price.

text:Cashmere especially should last for a long time. The issue is with fast fashion companies selling cheap and low quality cashmere. It doesn't last and the impact on the producers of raw material is horrific.  But I agree with you, most of my stuff hold up very long.

I know my grandparents used to have a rule about no hats at the dining table, so I‚Äôd take mine off then (this was when I was a kid and had a sunhat - it was also impolite to put your hat on the table even if there was room).   I want a bucket hat but haven‚Äôt found one I like yet!	episode_done:True
text:Fellow clothing trackers, what coveted items are you tracking now?	labels:I thrifted the PERFECT jeans 8 years ago... American eagle ‚Äúsuper stretch‚Äù high waisted jeans. They are from the era just before Jeggings. Still enough denim to be warm, thick and resilient. Well I wore them so freaking much I wore them out. Holes and stains the works. They have now become my house project jeans. And every time I put them on I actually sigh they are so comfortable! Just enough give to just move with me. So long story short I have them on poshmark notifications, every time I go into a thrift store I look for them in my size. They aren‚Äôt super hard to find but I‚Äôm a 0 long and that‚Äôs not a size I see often. It‚Äôs to the point I know what they feel like compared to other jeans and can spot them really fast. THREE DAYS AGO I FOUND THEM IN MY SIZE AGAIN. I practically ran to the check out. When I pulled them out of the dryer and put them on I actually danced. They are so perfect! Don‚Äôt give up on your hunt it might be out there! I‚Äôve decided to start looking for a replacement pair now so I never have to go with out them again.	episode_done:True

text:Colour/Style Matching - How do I figure out the potential of my wardrobe?	labels:Instagram!  Seriously, it's the best place to go to for style challenges, and even if you don't want to participate publicly, you can do it just for yourself, and also great for getting a ton of styling ideas and figuring out what you like in general.  As for developing an eye... exposure to a ton of different styles is pretty helpful; it helps you develop your preferences.	episode_done:True

text:Winston & Co. Shawl Collar Cardigan Review (But mostly preamble)	labels:This is good stuff. I think the important takeaway is that there are really not likely going to be shortcuts here - you are likely going to find scratchiness at lower price points, and moving up the pricing ladder, you may find that the ply numbers align with price = wool sweaters whose weight is in pounds not ounces are going to cost $XXX not $XX.  Also, if you do value horn versus leather buttons, you are further slicing your options - there is a strong correlation with Scottish knits with "tradition", and that means the default tends to be leather buttons. In fact, years ago I was at NMWA when a S&C order came in... with leather buttons. I think that meant they had to ship back a few cubic yards worth of cardigans
text:You're right, there aren't short cuts to this level of quality.  I think this knit represents the best entry level option for this sort of sweater. It's not as heavy, but it's FAR from insubstantial.  I don't mind the leather buttons, but they definitely add a level of "Old fogey" vibes if you're not careful.  Even horn buttons can miss the mark, I saw the new Spier & Mackay chunky cardigan and a common comment is that the buttons are just a bit too large.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:For the parents of girls	labels:As a daughter. My mom and I went shopping together. And we figured what would be appropriate for my age that we were both happy with. And then i would dress myself. My mom always says that i came up with some crazy choices. But it is part of your development. You figure out who you are through clothes.
text:Same, My mom would set outfits together in the closet at first but I would always mix and match so she eventually stopped at around 4 years old. As long as I had clothes on my body appropriate for the weather she let me do what I wanted (even from before I could actually put on the clothes on my own). Some days I would literally put on a clown wig with my clothes and my mom let me roll with it. I‚Äôm 24 now but we did a lot of shopping limited too and thrifting at the goodwill &salvation army. My sister and I were the same size in everything until after we graduated high school so we always shared a single wardrobe. I could pick out what I wanted (within reason) even from a really early age.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Adapting to age/workplace appropriate attire while staying true to yourself [discussion]	labels:I absolutely have this dilemma too.

text:FAQ: What are the different use cases of boat shoes, moccasins, driving shoes, and loafers?	labels:Been wearing driving loafers for about 10yrs. I'm 40, and a car enthusiast since my kindergarten days. I initially found some Puma driving shoes to wear. These were great, because I wear a 16 and the tighter cut of the shoe helped me just do things normally. Good feel for my pedal modulation too.  I needed something more professional for business casual dress at work however, and driving loafers were perfect. Steve Madden & Kenneth Cole got me started, and I've had some Cole Haan & Rockport as well. Different price points, but they've all been great.	episode_done:True
text:Reigning Champ Hoodie: 2 months later	labels:OP, I think your experience is an outlier and not representative of the brand. I've owned 10+ items from RC over the past few years.  I only ever had one incident with a pair of sweatpants that developed a rip in the pocket in the first few weeks of wear. I sent RC an email explaining the situation, and they happily sent me a replacement pair and a prepaid label to have the defective pair shipped back. It's entirely possible the rip was my fault and I didn't notice (could've easily snagged it on something), but they took care of me.  I would try contacting them and see if they can do anything for you. At 2 months, it may be pushing it, but if you make an effort to articulate your situation, you might get a replacement. Mention that you took the advice of online fashion forums when you made your purchase and that you were surprised by the poor durability and that you think you may have gotten a defective item. It's always worth a shot!	episode_done:True

text:Accessories newbie and am not sure where to start...what are your must-have starter pieces?	labels:My most essential accessories:  * work purse * weekend purse * going out purse * day to day versatile earrings * day to day statement earrings * fancy event statement earrings * going out statement earrings * short day to day necklace * pendant necklace * statement necklace * day to day ring (hand washing friendly) * cocktail ring (a big one that is fun for parties) * Bracelets - these are hard for me day to day, they get in the way of typing. I think they are better served for weekends and parties. I have a full range, but I go in waves on wearing them often. If you are more jewelry maximal, having a said of wear every day bracelets and fancy occasion ones is the right wardrobe. But the shapes you should choose vary based on wrist size and preferences. I like cuffs over bangles. And I do not like tennis bracelets, I am not a delicate jewelry person.  Sources?   * local craft events * Coach - bags, occasionally costume jewelry * Kate Spade - I like their whimsical costume jewelry, the bags are OK * I have some fave jewelry stores nearby: Crown Nine, Phillipa Roberts, Esquleto, Cielomar. I tend to like geometric shapes, and not colorful jewelry because I am really colorful in my wardrobe.  I generally don't love shopping on Etsy, it is hard to find the gold amongst all the stuff, I don't like the hunt, I like curated sources. Some things are well made and some things I could have made myself with no training. It is hard to discern based on a shop listing.	episode_done:True

text:Runways have been sending out 2000s vibes. Anyone onboard?	labels:I'm just going to lay it out there: I hate it. I hate the return of the Mean Girls/bitchy rich white girl/fucking velour Juicy tracksuit look. Probably because I started high school in 2001 and it was like the hey day of bland tackiness and Paris Hilton and I'm too close to it, lived it a little too much, to find any novelty in it. SO vapid. I was slightly vapid and a little mean for a while around that time before I came into myself and I don't like the reminders.  What I do like about the looks above though, is that I see the 60s and 90s Spice Girls influences and I can get into that.  Edit: also, on occasion, I wear low rise pants, but I like looking at trends for inspiration and new ideas, not dictating what I can or can't wear. If you like low rise jeans and hipster minis, rock em. If not, fuck em forever, who cares.
text:The tackiness of it is a FINE LINE. Your point about seeing 60s and 90s influence in this looks is important. I  love 60s and 70s fashion. I feel some of it was a bit mix matchy and almost tacky but way more sleek that early 2000s. I've been buying vintage 60s and 70s stuff and love it. I want bell sleeves and groovy patterns to have a bigger comeback than 2000s stuff.	labels:	episode_done:True

What are some of your favourites?	labels:As long as it smells nice, I can't say I have a particular opinion on the person because of their perfume. I would probably judge more on whether it is too overpowering.   I've always worn one that I think is nice, but I now wonder if it's too smoky when my clothing choices aren't overly feminine, so I'm wondering if I should mix it up with something more floral. Perhaps wear the smoky one when I'm in feminine outfits and wear something more floral when I'm in less feminine clothing.	episode_done:True
text:Influencers with Jobs: A Brief Collection	labels:Style Apotheca on Youtube is a pharmacist!   I definitely prefer to keep up with influencers who have real jobs for a few reasons.   Firstly, I don‚Äôt love when every other post or video is an ad. It makes it difficult to differentiate between actual personal style content and what‚Äôs just an ad for a company I‚Äôm not interested in shopping at. I don‚Äôt like being Sold something every time I watch a style video, and I find you get that less from influencers who get income from day jobs.  Secondly, as you say, there is a bit more realism in what they‚Äôre posting. Style doesn‚Äôt happen in a void, it has to happen in our daily lives. I don‚Äôt wear four-inch heeled boots to work, and I don‚Äôt like watching a college-age girl try and make Work Relatable content by making ‚ÄúWork Outfits‚Äù with four inch heeled boots. Influencers who have day jobs understand what it is boring office employees like me are looking for in a work outfit üòä sure, maybe because of their ‚Äúinfluencing‚Äù work they spend more money buying high-end clothing items that I‚Äôm simply never going to justify buying, but I don‚Äôt tend to follow people like that for very long.

text:Lower quality items during Nordstrom Anniversary Sale?	labels:There are a few brands that do this (Vince and Theory are the ones I've encountered...). Back when I worked in a more formal industry I was shopping for a Theory suit. At Nordstrom Rack the suit was unlined and a wool/poly blend. At Nordstrom the suit was wool with a poly half-lining. And at the Theory flagship in NYC the suit was pure wool with some natural or cellulose full lining (it's been a few years... but it definitely wasn't poly). This was ostensibly the same suit - similar silhouette and the same name, just a few numbers on the product ID differed. And of course the fit when I tried them on was noticeably different, from the Rack one being like a very cheap imitation, the Nordstrom one being pretty good, and the flagship one fitting like a glove.   Similarly, I recently bought some AllSaints moto boots from 6pm fully expecting them to be a diluted version. Instead they were the same cow leather lined with goat leather I tried in store. Considering how these things usually go, a happy surprise (no way in hell are they worth the $450 at full price). Side note: 6pm secretly lists most of their stock on Amazon with Prime fulfillment, which is great because their return policy sucks.
text:I‚Äôve definitely learned to check material content on the designer/non-house brands. Occasionally Nordstrom returns end up at the Rack outside of the normal sales cycle for the item and are a good deal. But you‚Äôre right- a lot more polyester than silk, etc for most of the items there	labels:	episode_done:True

He's 30 years old, and I'd describe his style as somewhere about halfway between basic-bro and hipster. Red Wings Heritage line would be perfect, but I don't know if I can swing $300.  Any less expensive alternatives? Around $200 or less would be great. He lives in Colorado - so they'll need decent tread for snow and such. Thanks in advance!
text:I picked up a pair of black Thursday Boots Captains a couple of months ago. The company has been bashed on reddit pretty thoroughly in the past, but for $200 I'm quite pleased with them. Most of the "Buy ____ instead" suggestions I read involve waiting for sales on factory seconds or things like the redwings that straight-up cost more money.  The version I got is basically a combat boot for a smart casual office dress code, and they are great for that. Quality-wise they're worlds better than the $100 boots that they replaced.  In your case (Colorado, snowy sidewalks, etc) I might lean towards one of the "rugged and resilient" leather options.

text:General Discussion - November 28, 2020	labels:There's a part of me that wants to lean into "Small business Saturday" and buy something from Etsy or wherever, but damn, they don't make it easy. It's such a wasteland of drop-shipped Alibaba products, cheap crafts (like Gildan tees that have been tie-dyed or bleached and then upsold for $50), and just straight up scams (i.e. polyester being marketed as wool), finding actual stores by actual craftspeople seems a total crapshoot. I know they must exist because I know actual craftspeople who sell through Etsy but unfortunately they seem like the minority. I wonder if anybody has ever made like a Chrome extension or something to cross reference Etsy with Alibaba/Aliexpress to at least filter the shameless "I'm even reselling using Aliexpress's same photography" 1:1 matches.
text:This is the same problem I have with eBay. I'm sure they have exactly what I want _somewhere_ but digging through all the mislabeled or fake crap is exhausting and not worth it.   Especially disappointing when you see something "handmade" that looks nice in the photo, immediately followed by several listings from different sellers with different titles using the same photo.  Or how the reviews for an item saying "great quality!" are actually for different items from the same seller.  _Ugh._	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Your Chore Coat Isn‚Äôt Up to the Task	labels:I have a hard time trying to think of any piece of informal menswear that doesn't come from a military or working class background besides athletic wear. Even then, of course you're going to find people not wearing it for its original function
text:This.  I can't stand the bizarre gate keeping that exists around fashion. It was everyone's favourite take down during the height of the americana/heritage/workwear cycle in the past decade.   MFA still sees it constantly from lurkers who complain about the outfits around here. I hate it.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What do you guys think about sites like Poshmark and Curtsey?	labels:Poshmark and ebay tend to be my first stops when I'm looking for a specific item.  (People go through things so quickly these days that pre-covid I'd often try on something at a store and find it barely worn on poshmark in my size while I was still in the fitting room.)  I find them much easier to narrow things down to exactly what I want than other sites.    If I have a general idea of what I'm looking for but I'm not looking for a specific item, I also like thredup.  I haven't used curtsey enough to have a real opinion on it, as I prefer desktop but I don't like their website.
text:This might be a stupid question but I‚Äôve never used eBay to buy clothes. Is there a certain way to do it? Lol I stopped using eBay years ago when I kept getting ripped off üôÑ	labels:Personally I only use ebay when I'm looking for something really specific, usually either an exact item that I know my size in or a specific type of vintage item.  That makes the search function much easier to use.  (You can also set alerts to tell you when something that fits your parameters is posted.)    Check measurements, look at the photos carefully (and make sure they're the seller's photos, not stock photos, with the possible exception of new overstock items), and read the condition description.  Ask questions if you need to.  I don't order anything without measurements unless it's a contemporary item and I already know my size in it.    In terms of getting ripped off, check the seller's feedback.  You want both positive feedback and a lot of feedback.  But ebay's changed a lot since the early days.  I've never not gotten what I thought I was getting.

text:What are some habits that keep clothes/shoes new vs that habits that ruin them?	labels:Give shoes a day break between wearings.  A shoe repair guy said that even with socks, shoes absorb a lot of moisture from our feet. He suggested going  at least day on day off with shoes to give them time to dry and regain their shape. Otherwise he said they stay in that moist, malleable state and get out of shape more quickly.  Anecdotally I‚Äôve seen a major difference in the lifespan of my shoes.
text:This. I really need to do this. I bought nice quality leather ankle boots but I keep wearing them every single day. So much so that I don‚Äôt get around getting the vibram soles and heel tips when I need to. I think I need to invest in two pairs of similar shoes that I love and can alternate between. Both pairs will probably last a lot longer if I do this.	labels:I've given up on fixing shoes. I tried a few times and was told the formed soles weren't really made for that anymore, everything is toss and replace. Maybe I just buy cheap stuff? I usually spend 80-120 for a pair of ankle boots.	episode_done:True
text:What‚Äôs some of the best general advice you‚Äôd give to someone new to female fashion?	labels:Lots of good advice here already. One thing maybe worth adding: be aware that a lot of women's retailers use soft-feeling but lower quality fabric. At places like Zara and H&M, the men's clothes will be made of nice cotton or wool blends, and then nearly identical garments in the women's section will be flimsy rayon blends (knitwear, especially). It's easy to get duped by something that feels nice in the shop, until you get home and realise it's made of nasty sweaty acrylic. The stitching and construction can also be shoddier, so you'll end up with garments that look warped and awkward after one wash. (My husband is often shocked by the difference in quality when we shop together.) Maybe you've already noticed this, but I wish someone had told me these things when I started shopping for myself :)  Another thing to know is a lot of women's clothes are labeled "dry clean only" or "hand wash only." You'll want to carefully read the labels so you don't ruin anything! The tumble dryer is not your friend, except for socks/undies/workout clothes. That said, most "dry clean only" items that aren't heavily embellished can be gently hand washed and air dried, but if you don't want the hassle, check the label before you buy.	episode_done:True
text:Anyone else missing party clothes?	labels:I feel like I literally got no occasion to dress when in lockdown. I am happy my country now allows some occasions	episode_done:True
text:How to build a style with a limited outlet?	labels:I would start with good quality basics. Having a good foundation will allow you to expand with more trendy or style defining pieces, but it‚Äôs very hard to achieve a personal style without the first step. Unfortunately it does take time to find the right pieces, but I would suggest watching fashion YouTubers as a resource so you can see people try on clothes and get a better sense of the fit or quality.	episode_done:True

text:Sweats and Hoodies	labels:In defence of sweatpants (the comment I was responding to got deleted but I spent a few minutes typing a response on my phone so didn‚Äôt want to just delete what I typed):  I can certainly see where you are coming from in regards to sweatpants. I can‚Äôt (or haven‚Äôt yet at least) worn them outside because I‚Äôm too concerned about what other people think and self-conscious (which is ridiculous in the grand scheme of things). I think part of the draw for me is how unbelievably effortless and confident some of these fits are. The impossibly laid back styling that Japanese magazines like popeye, cluel and fudge for some reason really interests me. To me these fits aren‚Äôt all exactly what I‚Äôd like to replicate, but I think they give me some useful tips in dressing down some coats and jackets which can often come across as too formal.	episode_done:True

text:In my opinion, none of those brands are really worth the price. Salvatore Ferragamo definitely isn‚Äôt, most of their shoes aren‚Äôt welted, and their high end line is the same price as St. Crispins.   Brunello Cucinelli is nice, but you can get nicer for the same price. They don‚Äôt really have any handwork and their designs aren‚Äôt that interesting for the most part.   Maybe Saint Laurent because of the designs and vibe might be worth it, but definitely not because of the quality.

text:Do you have any pieces that "should not" work with your body that just seems to work?	labels:I find most rules are trash, and ascribe to shaming women for having different features. If you have broad shoulders, a padded blazer with sharp lines can be such an aesthetic.   I find if you don't believe in fashion rules, there's always a version of something that will work for you.
text:I don't find that at all. I watched a video where 4 women with different body shapes all tried styles that weren't supposed to be flattering. At the end of the video, the opinions hadn't changed.  I do see how that can be limiting & believe that people should wear whatever they want regardless though.	labels:I mean, a video intended to prove a point is going to select examples that support their argument, no?	episode_done:True
text:People who used to play super safe with fashion, how did you overcome your fear of bold choices?	labels:I wear it at home. So I can get used to it without others seeing me.

text:Overdressing - Discussion	labels:I work on political campaigns for a living, and part of putting together event briefings for candidates is deciphering the dress code and putting in plain English what they should wear.  Neither of these were my candidates, but I have seen two candidates overdressed for the event-- one man and one woman (of opposing parties).  This particular event was a beach cleanup sponsored by an environmental group.  Volunteers were gathered to literally pick up trash from the beach.   If anything, the accessory of the day was cleaning gloves.  The male candidate wore a designer suit and newly shined dress shoes.  The female candidate wore a skirt suit (think Sarah Palin) with 4 inch stilettos.    This event was back in 2011.  When I put together what a candidate should wear to an event, I think of these two candidates dressed to the nines to pick up garbage from the beach.   This is NOT an image you want to convey to voters.
text:I think this is an excellent example of when I think overdressing is rude.  How you dress communicates things. If you show up to a situation where messy and/or physical activities are planned and you're not dressed appropriately, you're essentially communicating distain for the planned activities. It's a non-verbal declaration of "you all go ahead and get dirty, I'll just watch."   If you're too good for picking up trash, why did you come to the trash cleanup day? If you knew you weren't going to participate in our frisbee game, why did you come to the frisbee party? Why did you come camping if you aren't prepared to let any part of you touch dirt - are you expecting everyone else to do extra work to make your camping experience squeaky clean? The only way to avoid that message is to dive right in and ruin your nice clothes.	labels:Well said, this is really the core of it.  I'd also add that being overdressed (or underdressed) to an event with a dress code can also show disrespect for the host who chose the dress code.  For instance, being noticeably overdressed for a wedding could indicate that you think it's improper for someone to have a wedding that casual.

I can definitely feel that the quality is great however the comfort is currently not up to par.  The back of the shoe on my heel fricken HURTS everytime I walk. I understand that you have to break them in, but is this something thats gonna be fixed by continuing to 'walk-it off'?   From what I see, the problem is the thread in the back thats just sorta protruding and jabbing itself into my foot.  From people who have purchased this shoe brand, did any of your experiences relate to mine? Were they fixed by breaking them in?
text:Sometimes its just how your feet/ankles are shaped. My ankles get fucked up by various shoes that don't bother other people.

text:What work for my boyfriends taste and body type?	labels:I have found the best way to hide my dad-bod tummy features that I‚Äôm self conscious of is through layering. This is very weather specific, but one of my go to options is a t-shirt, an open flannel, then a denim jacket. You can smarten it up with a nicer shirt buttoned up.   Another strategy I really like when I‚Äôm trying new things that I‚Äôm not quite comfortable with is to wear it out for an hour or so (like go get coffee, walk in a park, or something like that where you aren‚Äôt too social but still in public) then go home and put on clothes more in my comfort zone. I have found this slowly builds my confidence bit by bit and allows my to trial run things for what works and what doesn‚Äôt.   Playing into the braid shoulders might be a good idea as well. That‚Äôs something typically masculine that looks good. Trying suspenders instead of a belt (or just not tightening the belt too much, so as not to accentuate the belly again) is a good option. Where long sleeves either rolled or pushed up can make upper arms look bigger too. I like a Henley style shirt this way as the cut is very masculine there.  Find pictures, have them on your phone while shopping to try to find inexpensive alternatives.
text:I think layering will make him a lot more confident to try new things. I feel so bad for him with his insecurities. He sees his belly as really big when it‚Äôs not it‚Äôs just not flat like a models. And he always wants to cover it.   I think he does need to slowly build his confidence up. Just a bit at a time like you said. And Henley shirts looks like they‚Äôll really suit him!

There are tons of ways to go beyond a button-down shirt and a pencil skirt. Interesting fabrics, for example, or subtle accessories that are more reflective of your personality.
text:This exactly. I have a pretty stuffy office job with a fairly traditional business dress code (not business formal, but the kind of business casual where jeans are 100% not okay, people wear pantyhose with skirts, blazers are extremely popular, absolutely no thighs or cleavage or shoulders seen), but I still have no trouble finding work-appropriate clothing that makes me feel comfortable and that I like to wear.   I have pretty loud taste and I am not one for neutrals, while also being pretty conservative with regard to the amount of skin I like to show, and I love to find stuff with bold colours (like my very favourite suit, which is bright magenta), strong shapes (like oversized boyfriend blazers instead of a traditional hip-length fitted ones, wide paperbag pants, cape sleeves, etc), and unusual patterns, like a cardigan I have with small intarsia unicorn silhouettes. I only buy the shapes I like, so no pencil skirts, high necklines only, pant rises similar to those in my casual wardrobe, etc.   I absolutely live in athleisure outside the office, but I still like and enjoy my work wardrobe a lot and I think it's still expressive while being appropriate for my specific office. I pretty much only wear it to work and I don't pull any of it out to go to the grocery store, but it's still great for the purpose and I don't need to be able to wear all my clothes for every occasion.	labels:	episode_done:True

I have a decorative ladder for the clothes that aren‚Äôt ready to be washed but are worn. My husband sucks at this and used to drape his clothes all over the fucking place so I got him the ladder originally but now we both use it and it‚Äôs good for keeping clothes off the floor or our couches  But honestly mostly I have an IKEA Pax system that keeps things super organized for me and which I love dearly. It‚Äôs a bit pricey but if you have a lot of clothes and are serious about organizing them, I highly recommend

You might catch yourself setting certain outfits aside, and those are key moments to train yourself to look out for. When you find yourself doing it, make a choice. Some days you may simply wish to be comfortable, no shame. But it may also be important to recognize it makes you feel uncomfortable for now, and then do it anyway.

text:What age did you start pinning down your style? And how many times has it changed since then?	labels:I had a general style from a relatively young age, like teenage years. Kind of preppy, kind of quirky, lots of animals on my tops, lots of jewel tones, etc. I'd play around with buying other types of looks, but most of them left my closet pretty quickly. In my early/mid 20s, I did have this horrible period where I thought I needed to "grow up" so I purged a *ton* of stuff and thought I was just going to stick to neutrals and sleek lines and be very polished, or my idea of polished...I was miserable and by the time I was in my late 20s, began rebuilding my wardrobe to be filled with more things that just make me smile. I do have some of my neutrals hanging around. I learned I don't hate them, as long as they have texture or dramatic sleeves or things like that. So I guess the experience wasn't a total wash...  But yeah, I'm 31 and my style journey is just kind of ending up where I was at like 3. (I mean, I just bought a sweater of a giraffe, haha) But it was really about just kind of accepting who I am and realizing I'm probably not going to outgrow a lot the idiosyncrasies the way I thought I "should" ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è	episode_done:True

For when I'm at a new job that involves being in an office all day, travelling through snow and sleet and rain and sunshine üòÑ Right now I'm working from home and my outfits are pajamas and slippers.  Also, there was a lot of comfort shopping too, this year has been brutal and painful. If some new boots can make me smile for a week, it's worth it.
text:I'm normally very frugal but this year gets a hard pass on spending. I only look at my CC statement to make sure I am not getting rooked on double charges and the like....but the total is hard to look at....and a lot of that is on things like shorts and shirts and things and I rode through the desert on a horse with no name...it felt good to be out of the rain.  Oof. I mean I can easily afford the spending but it feels weird.	labels:>I only look at my CC statement to make sure I am not getting rooked on double charges and the like....but the total is hard to look at.

It's been about 5 years since I last did any online clothing shopping, but I've had pretty good luck with it so far, but I've got a good eye for what shapes are gonna work for me, and I always message the seller about something before I buy.

text:Prada FW21 Menswear (Miuccia Prada and Raf Simons)	labels:Love it. I've always liked Raf when he's grounded by the history of another fashion house as opposed to his own eponymous label.

I'm really excited to see what he has in store for the women's line as I found the output at Dior really great.	episode_done:True
text:Thoughts on ski / apres ski style?	labels:Skiing is a strenuous sport, often done in a dangerous alpine climate. I wear technical gear: bright loose waterproof jacket and pants for visibility and mobility, wicking warm base layers, balaclavas and goggles to protect my eyes and skin, a helmet, and a backpack or fanny pack with an emergency kit.   After skiing, I strip off the outer layers and walk around in uggs, tights, and turtleneck.   You know what? I 100% blend in. I don't look better or worse than the hundreds of other people who have just come down from the mountain. This is why people specifically wear bright colors. Your party will be able to identify you at a distance from the specific colors you're wearing.   I think ski/apres ski style is to skiing what cottage core is to farming/homesteading. It's an aesthetic for people who don't actually do it.   If you like the look and aren't interested in skiing, then look into some New England heritage preppy looks. The bean boots, scandi wool sweaters, thick stretchy stirrup pants, fluffy trimmed accessories, and parkas may appeal to you. Uniqlo has some cute stuff in their recent collab that has that cozy lux vibe. Moncler and Gorsuch are some OG European ski fashion wear companies. You could look into those for inspiration.   But definitely don't try to go skiing without a waterproof pant and jacket combo. You will have a terrible time, given how much you will likely fall. (Assuming that you're a beginner.)

It's an aesthetic for people who don't actually do it.  I can agree with this.  I live 20 miles from Breck, and any person you see who has been out on the slopes are wearing fearing athletic and technical looking gear.  For most restaurants, people aren't dressed in furs or look glam at all.  It's mostly basic bitch type winter garb - knit hats with a fur pom pom, long puffer jackets, skinny jeans.    If you go to Aspen though that's a bit of a different story.  More money over there so you'll see "fancier" people.	labels:20 miles is 32.19 km	episode_done:True

text:What is your ideal first date outfit?	labels:Back when I did online dating and went on lots of first dates, I tended to keep it super casual and then just have one really flashy thing. Like jeans, sneakers, solid T-shirt, and flashy chandelier earrings. Or skip earrings and wear sequin shorts instead of jeans. If they wanted to go somewhere fancy, I just always talked them down into my comfort zone (i.e. a bar where all the staff know me, at least by sight) and will try to keep me safe if I need it.

Try finding ways to support women of color‚Äôs businesses, especially!   Instagram resale is big now, too.

I find that the Gap in my city basically have the bare minimum - ocbd‚Äôs, polos, tshirts, jeans and chinos which makes shopping much easier; whereas Uniqlo has tons of varieties with their different pieces and takes time to figure out the difference. Gap is just a little bit more expensive but does this mean they‚Äôre much better quality too?
text:Most westerners seem to have a big preference for uniqlo. I've checked them out locally, and in multiple countries. Quality is consistent across the board and good for the price.   I would say both brands are about even in quality cause Gap is actually pretty good especially when on sale (my experience is limited to Gap Japan though). The T shirt fabrics for both brands are nice, but a bit thin if that matters (tropical weather here so these are a big plus for me). Uniqlo has great collabs though and some of the seasonal collab designs might appeal to you.   I think for the dress shirts and pants...youre probably gonna have to base your decision on price, fit, and design preferences. That's what I'd prioritize when choosing between budget-ish brands anyways.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Are jean shorts on men really that bad?	labels:Listen, there are very few things, if any, in menswear that are always wrong.  But as far as single items go, jorts are very, very, very rarely right.  Denim is a generally a heavy, workwearish fabric designed to protect your legs. Shorts are generally worn for comfort -- they should be lighter, or softer, or both. And there are a few more reasons that jorts are... unnatural, but... They are, don't wear them unless you *really* know your shit. Like, "studies runway shows like an academic" level of knowing your shit.

text:What are your tips for being stylish when your weight fluctuates like crazy?	labels:Wrap dresses and wrap skirts tend to be flexible with size fluctuations. I don‚Äôt know if the same wrap skirt can take you from a size 4 to 14 but they‚Äôll fit longer than other styles do.
text:YESS! I love wrap clothes. Get a set of cheaper undershirts in different sizes, wraps, shawls, dusters, are all amazing. And you can get them from super nice brands so it's not like you're just trying to clothe yourself. You can get yourself a wardrobe this way that you are excited about and great quality. Add some belts for your waist, some skirts that are either stretch your some other way to tighten and you are golden.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:does anyone else struggle with this pattern? if so, how do you FIX?!	labels:Idk if this applies but don't build your outfits/wardrobe around current trends (i.e. everything galaxy not so long ago).

text:How would you describe the quality of self-knit/self-made clothes vs. store bought?	labels:My handknit sweaters look great and have lasted much longer than my store bought sweaters.

text:What is your ideal first date outfit?	labels:I prefer getting drinks for a first date. I think having a dinner date is too formal/too much of a (time) commitment when I‚Äôm just trying to get to know a person and feel each other out. It‚Äôs easier to dip out after a drink and there is less financial involvement.   Usually I wear a pair of statement earrings and one other statement piece (can be anything: jacket, top, etc). The rest I keep pretty basic (aka the rest of my outfit is black).   I wear a lot of black generally, so on a first date, I want to wear something that is representative of what I wear on day-to-day.	episode_done:True

Inevitably the comments use the word "hipster" as an insult when it is so clearly a euphemism for "fag".    The whole thing is so gross and tiring. I guess that can be said for lots of stuff in 2020.

text:Fashion "fantasies" coming true years later?	labels:There are items that I fell in love with when I was a teenager/student, but could never afford. Now that I‚Äôm an adult and making decent money I‚Äôve actually purchased a few of these items second hand on Vestiaire Collective or Vinted. The top two are an Alexander McQueen silk skull print scarf and a Mulberry Alexa bag. Certainly not the trendiest of items nowadays but I am thrilled with them and younger me is so happy I finally own them after all these years of wanting them.
text:oh my god... I also had drooled over the Alexander McQueen silk skull print scarf back in the day! I was (and still am) also a huge fan of Mulberry and hopefully I'll be able to snag one of their bags one day. So glad you were able to make those purchases for the younger you!	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What‚Äôs your favorite winter fashion staple?	labels:A couple crew neck sweaters in neutral colours I can jazz up with a fashionable scarf. That way if it's warm, I can take the scarf off. Under them I wear tank tops.  I match up my warm scarf with my jackets. I have 2 wool coats which help but if it's below -20C I like to wear my ski jacket(s).  I prefer earmuffs to toques because of my hair and I have a black pair, a brown pair, a white pair and a pair that goes great with my favourite ski jacket.  I have 3 styles of winter boots:   \-low, very fashionable (leather and fake fur) and good long term until about -10C .. these I am likely to wear to go to the mall or whatnot   \-tall, very fashionable (wool) and good long term until about -10C .. these I wear rarely even though I love them, they're a pain because they make my legs really warm indoors but my feet get too cold outdoors   \-mid rise, mildly fashionable and good till -35C .. these are my everyday boots, running errands, off to work, shoveling snow etc  Fleece-lined tights for more a more casual look.  If I'm going to be able to stow my stuff and it's really cold (like -30C or colder) I'll wear fleece pants over my nice pants and take them off at my destination.	episode_done:True
text:How has your style grown/changed since before quarantine?	labels:I have been able to really hone in on my style! It‚Äôs not that it has changed, it‚Äôs just that I‚Äôve been able to buy things that are more in-line with it. Actually, the trends this year of ruffles, bows and puffy peeves are my actual style, so, I‚Äôm advantage of having all of my favorite things being readily accessible.	episode_done:True
text:How do you challenge yourself?	labels:There was a time when I only wore hoodies, then I only wore sweaters. To diversify, i started by trying to buy different colors (I mostly had grey, black and green). At first I found it really hard to wear a different 'bolder' color. Once I felt comfortable with colors, I tried to buy different texture or materials. And now that I have different texture I'm trying different cuts. It's been a fun process and I was taking it very slow because I was so used to only wearing hoodies that anything else felt weird.	episode_done:True

text:Let's Talk about hats	labels:There is hat etiquette from the days of yore. Here are some of the conventions that were adhered to:  A lady does not remove her hat when indoors or for the national anthem. This is in contrast to men, who are to remove hats when indoors and for the anthem. However, if you‚Äòre sporting a baseball cap at a ballgame, I would remove it for the anthem, whereas if you were wearing a more formal outfit with hat then I would not remove it.  A hat is a daytime piece in most cases not suitable for evening wear. The fascinator is an exception to this rule, but is more of a Commonwealth/British thing.  A lady does not wear a hat in her own home, ie when receiving guests, and as a guest in a friend‚Äôs home a lady would remove her hat.

text:How do I find out what I really like and want?	labels:My situation was the opposite as far as I know me and my sister were allowed to choose to wear what we wanted from as early as I remember. I also had a job as a teen so I could afford my fashion design hobby. I'm in my early 30s now and I think I finally found my style, but I'm struggling to feel amazing about it as I'm a bit overweight and I think things that I like simply look better on slimmer women.  Anyhow: I experimented loads as a teen and ever since, really. Buying things, wearing them or not, making things. It takes time to figure out which of the things you own get a lot of wear and which don't. You could go to second hand shops as it's cheaper to buy more here to experiment with. A lot also depends on any demands from your job, if you currently work. If you can freely wear whatever, you can go nuts. Some things that are great staples irrespective of style are some quality black leggings, nice trainers, good tops or bras for support, a nice handbag, backpack, and a few nice coats.  You could flip through magazines or websites and save any photos of style that appeals to you or simply individual pieces you like. Look at people in the street and take notes of any insights you gain from that.  I was very into goth stuff for daily wear until I went to art school and didn't want to get nice clothes dirty so I ended up wearing sports/athleisure gear. Now that I have a working from home office job I'm just wearing athleisure)chill stuff too but when I go out I try to dress in my style, which I've accepted is boho/eclectic/a mix. I've stopped trying to find a style and I'll just wear individual things I like, so I end up with a lot going on at times (big coat, patterned leggings, coloured trainers, hippie jewellery, an army style cross body bag etc. That's just me. I'm happy to look a bit strange and not according to one style.  You'll get there :).	episode_done:True
text:Looking for a Shear Thing (Shearling Jackets)	labels:I love the look of a proper B3 Shearling Bomber.

text:Purses: Real vs. Faux Leather?	labels:I can‚Äôt stand faux leather. Not for shoes, bags, clothes; anything. Plastic can start to degrade after some time (6-10 years). I had some faux leather hiking boots that turned to mush just sitting in their box in my closet. The handles on faux leather purses start to peel and the bottoms wear very fast. They simply do not hold up like leather.  I have vintage Dooney&Bourke leather bags that are 25+ years old. I keep them polished, clean and in dust bags when not in use and they look new.  If you can afford a genuine leather bag, even secondhand, it is the best choice imo.
text:I bought a vintage D&B pebbled shoulder bag in dark purple off eBay earlier this year and am enthralled by its quality. The texture, the thick cloth lining, the stitching, everything.

text:No clue about winter wear. Please Help!	labels:The fundemental key to layering is wearing soft and porous garments beneath some sort of coat or jacket that is weather resistant or less likely to let air through. Where warmth is concerned, you want to trap air between your skin and the outside. This is why winter coats like parkas have their own insulation, meant to trap warm air.	episode_done:True
text:The Style Blogger Index: finding people who are the same size as you	labels:It's really interesting how someone with my height, size and even shape can be so different from me. I am right now quite into the Kibbe body type system, so it's helpful to understand that someone with my size and even same waist/bust can have a completely body structure (for example I am frame dominant and am visually wider and my bones are blunt, while someone else may be flesh dominant and have a very rounded frame, or might have quite sharp long bones, or a juxtaposition of both). This can make the same item of clothing look so different on two people.	episode_done:True
text:Matching shoes & purse	labels:I don‚Äôt think fashion has any rules anymore unless you‚Äôre royalty or it‚Äôs cultural.   I personally don‚Äôt like matchy matchy bag and shoes unless I‚Äôm going for a monochrome look. I tend to match tones rather than colours. I like a patterned bag (say Gucci dionysus or Fendi zucca or LV canvas) as opposed to patterned clothes because I find they blend in well with a variety of outfit choices.   If I do colour, I will make sure the tone matches. I can‚Äôt stand mixing warm times with cool tones. Eg I have a cool tone lilac paid of heels that I love wearing with my cool tone magenta bag.   You can also do opposite sides of the colour wheel with shoes and bags like a green bag and a purple/magenta pair of shoes. But again keep to the same tones. The key with fashion is the tone of colours, and that includes neutral colours too. I would always suggest everyone does a colour/tone analysis and then stick to buying items in that range. It makes mixing and matching easier.
text:Love the idea of matching from opposite sides of the color wheel. I do definitely try to stick to my season as well. Thanks for these awesome tips!	labels:	episode_done:True
text:When your personality and aesthetic don't quite match?	labels:Sounds like there's a problem with your bf, not your style.
text:Plus there are SO MANY MEN who know absolutely nothing about fashion or style. If he doesn‚Äôt even know the right terminology to use then he probably falls in this group.   It‚Äôs possible the boyfriend has an art school education, or participates in online fashion forums, or is very tapped into visual style (if so, he still could keep his opinions to himself)... but I‚Äôm betting it‚Äôs more likely he wears too much hair gel and the same crumpled t shirt and jeans most of the time. Which is also fine, but doesn‚Äôt make him qualified to comment on anyone else‚Äôs fashion choices.  OP, if you feel comfortable in it, go ahead and wear it. You‚Äôll work out what you like, and it‚Äôll probably evolve over the years. If you‚Äôre looking for more ideas, try searching tags on Instagram and pinning outfits online to refer back to.	labels:When an ex of mine (well-meaning but very much a bro) would make any remark about women's fashion, I'd just give him a look and say, "Yeah, ok, Mr Versace..." and that would shut that shit right down.	episode_done:True
text:Changing your mindset from fast fashion to one of investment pieces. What did you learn?	labels:It sounds like you're having trouble staying motivated so maybe you need to remember why you wanted to change your habits in the first place - you mentioned that you wanted to reinvent yourself.  For me, it took years and it's an ongoing process to change the way I think/buy, as well as to save up ad afford the nicer things I wanted. I would say that some main factors for me to change were that I became dissatisfied with the quality I saw (once you learn to sew, you can't unsee it), and I had a friend who was starting to buy nicer things. She made more money than I did, so it took more effort for me when I wanted to buy some, too.  I had to learn to do my research - follow the brands/makers, see what sales and discounts they offered, if any. It might take a season or easily longer to learn about their habits before I made my move. I also had to learn about when to just buy something full-price - if I thought I would be so disappointed to miss out, I'd consider buying the piece sooner. I wear a XS-S most of the time, so these sizes tend to sell out faster. Most of the time though, I had to learn to be patient, be honest with my style/needs, and shop smarter.	episode_done:True

The bare, white walls and flickering fluorescent lights remind me to never show a shred of personality to my coworkers, lest they suspect that I occasionally engage in activities outside of work. My dog's despondent whimpers recall the helpless cries of teenagers on the brink of a nervous collapse as they juggle arbitrary deadlines, crushing debt, and the insidious suspicion that it's all a bunch of bullshit. One big advantage of working from home is the ready supply of cheap coffee to keep me alert now that I'm expected to be available at any time--day, night, and weekend. I'm having heart palpitations and the entire left side of my face is numb, but my productivity is unmatched!

text:What are some differences between stereotypical Millennial and Gen Z fashion/aesthetics?	labels:I associate Gen Z fashion with crop tops and sweatpants, so yeah it makes sense that people in their 30's buying expensive ethical clothes aren't going for the sporty spice look.
text:Totally.  To me, Gen Z is a lot of clothing that isn‚Äôt work appropriate but super fun. A lot of crop tops, bra tops, spaghetti straps, usually some tummy showing, and then some baggy pants. Lots of thrifting and also cheap fast fashion. Doc Martens and other platform shoes. Very 90s/early 2000s. Long acrylic nails, false lashes. Really fun and can be a really ‚Äúhot but trashy‚Äù style   Millennial fashion is more professional/better quality/structured. Linens, trousers, heels, sandals, etc. Frankly I think it has to do with millennials having more money. Low key hair, nails and makeup. Neutral colours and patterns. It‚Äôs a more mature style   I‚Äôm 25 so I get to do both üòé woohoo	labels:As soon as Gen Z get a job they'll be all over trousers and linens lol.

text:Bruce Boyer on Finding Your Wardrobe and Sustainability in Fashion ‚Äì Put This On (Derek Guy )	labels:Really good read as expected from Bruce. I know that sustainability is thrown around a lot and it can be a bit hypocritical or at least out-of-touch in regards to classic menswear. On the surface it can even seem elitist, since its a luxury, though Bruce here has shown that even he experimented and seems to encourage people to try different modes of menswear apart from trying to be timeless all the time.  I think it would be great if Bruce talked more about his taste, like why he liked George Cleverly and Anderson & Sheppard (I know he mentioned sensible lapels, etc).  I think diving into taste (or POV as it were) a bit more as it relates to menswear details would help show guys that while J. Crew suits and Meermin are fine and can last a long time with proper care, sometimes aesthetics for the sake of aesthetics win out in how we acquire clothing.
text:yeah that creeping need to want to 'upgrade' or have the 'best' is a big contributor to the unsustainability of fashion i feel like. Even though you could sell/donate the item, it may just end up being thrown away or shipped out. I still have a donegal crewneck from j.crew i bought 9 yrs ago that i still love to wear, but I can't say that I've kept every piece of clothing like that.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:FAQ: When shopping on a budget, what items have the highest point at which they reach diminishing returns?	labels:In my experience, lower quality at lower price points is most noticeable for outerwear, footwear, or knits (I guess because they all serve a functional purpose) and spending more tends to lead to a more noticeable improvement in quality up to a certain point. That's painting with a broad brush though... leather dress shoes and boots scale much better than sneakers or sandals, where mid-range options are going to be good enough for most people.  T-shirts, dress shirts, denim, and accessories in low-to-mid-range are generally good enough from a quality perspective IMO and I've only really paid more in those categories for a design I like rather than because I think I'm getting something higher quality. There's nothing wrong IMO with buying something because you like the way it looks even if a similar quality alternative exists at a lower price, but that's harder to do if you're shopping on a budget.  I'll also add that for all of the above, your dollar goes a lot farther if you're willing to shop used. Sites like Ebay, Grailed, reddit/styleforum B/S/T threads, etc. have made it a lot easier to buy preowned clothes without having to set foot into a thrift store.  TL;DR When shopping on a budget I'd focus first on having a high quality pair of shoes and jacket. Consider buying used clothes to stretch your budget further.

You could even do themed Zoom cocktail hours with friends where you dress up in things you wouldn't otherwise get to wear.	episode_done:True
text:What is your most worn accessories?	labels:I have three pairs of gold hoop earrings, small, medium, and large; a gold initial necklace that I wear every day; a watch with a black band and mixed metals; a black handbag with gold hardware; lots of different colored scrunchies; a black knit beanie with a pompom that I wear almost every day in winter; two wool berets in black and raspberry respectively; three pairs of gloves in black leather, fuzzy white knit, and touchscreen-enabled orange cotton; and lots of pashmina-type scarves in different colors.  Edit: also my glasses, which have gold metal frames that go really well with my minimal gold jewelry.	episode_done:True
text:Do you have a concept of "Par Value" in menswear?	labels:I really enjoy this approach, it reminds me of leveling up an RPG character. Pushes lots of my good serotonin buttons, and of course means I can sit on a bigger pile of cash and be financially independent sooner!	episode_done:True

text:Shinies From the Past - or, What to do with Gifts from Past Relationships?	labels:Haha I definitely run into this same issue! I tend to associate items really strongly with the context in which I got them, and personally feel weird reselling gifts, so donations or trash bin it is for me.   I usually donate jewelry (depending on the piece) to organizations that specifically help people with interview/business-wear or prom outfits. I‚Äôve also donated gifted jewelry or suitcases to women‚Äôs shelters before.
text:I feel that! I agree, I like the idea of donating to someone who wouldn't otherwise have pieces like that. I think my main concern with donating is that it runs the risk of just being resold anyways at a thrift store, and likely not for what the item is worth.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:How do I know if my sense of style is really mine or is it defined by others?	labels:There's that saying that "you don't know what you don't know", right? I couldn't conjure up a completely original and personal style out of thin air without pulling up inspiration and learning about all kinds of different styles and clothes and fabrics and aesthetics et cetera et cetera. My style is just a big mix of all kinds of trends from the last five years, but it's personal to me because I curated it.  I like to think of personal style as an iterative process similar to design, you build on top of what's already there, see what works, what doesn't, remove unnecessary things until there's nothing left to take away. What remains is just right. The one thing to realise is that it's not something that happens overnight, most people who have a really strong sense of personal style have been doing it for years or decades.	episode_done:True
text:What are a few items that you feel are essential when planning a wardrobe?	labels:It all depends on your life and climate. I think a good waterproof coat is essential and weather proof boots, but if you like in a very very dry climate where it hardly rains, then obviously it is not. For some people snow boots and really heavy feather filled winter coats are essential, I got a coat and boots I only wear when travelling in winter to cooler places and they would be inadequate for a lot of places! I love jeans, some women hate the feeling and would rather do without.  I dunno. You got to you do you, think hard of what you find comfortable physically and mentally, what makes you think "pretty" or colors that cheer you up. How much do you walk? Shoe comfort and weather adequacy really matters.	episode_done:True

My wife is much closer to the wife and was really having some distress. My wife works in public health and directly with our COVID response.  Anyways, my wife posted a comment on a particularly inflammatory post and basically said it was affecting their friendship. They wound up having a phone call and it actually turned out positively, with the other person asking for some more information to look at contrary to her views.  Anyways, for now it was a positive outcome from something where I thought we‚Äôd have to cut someone out of our lives. Hard because our kids are friends too.  Also we had a provincial election here yesterday and our left-of-Centre (NDP) party absolutely wiped the floor with the centre-right party which is nice. They‚Äôve done a good job with COVID and other stuff so happy to keep going with that.

text:How does your makeup style and clothing style relate? - discussion	labels:Im Op I‚Äôll share mine-  Personally I sort of plan my makeup look based of what I‚Äôm wearing   I do mostly dramatic Smokey eyes and cut crease looks with bright blush and lipstick everywhere in colors that either match my outfit or just compliment it well! I also do more eye liner dramatic looks at times as well! Usually if I‚Äôm wearing something a bit more cutesy I‚Äôll do my makeup to reflect the look. If Im wearing my black velvet blazer set I‚Äôll do th√© likes of and orange and gold Smokey eye to make it more bold and less professional looking! I have a very dressy style with masculine, Victorian, and highly detailed elements so bold colorful makeup makes some of my more stuffy looks less boring. I‚Äôve lately been after doing my foundation putting a bit of blush from the bottom front of my eye bags to the top of my brow bone. I love how it makes makeup a little more unique and makes me look a little less baby faced.  I used to wear very skater boyish/ art kid outfits and hair ( I still respect the style still though ) but wore heavy Instagram glam style makeup. I still do glam makeup but it looked quite odd at times! I didn‚Äôt really think much about makeup in relation to clothing then, not that it‚Äôs really necessary! I feel I‚Äôve come far with my style!

text:I recently got a pile-lined fleece throw blanket from Uniqlo.  On especially cold days, I place it \*under\* my top sheet so it's directly on my skin and OMG...it feels so warm and comfortable!

Shirts, bottoms, skirts, dresses--- Usually 3-4 times depending on use.  Skirts-- 5-6 times (these don't touch the crotch area so they don't get as dirty as other bottoms).  Outer layers (sweaters, sweatshirts, etc)--- As needed (I always have something under these).  PJs-- 3-4 wears  Sheets-- Every 2 weeks or so  Towels-- Washcloths-- after each use (I use two a day to wash my face), body towel-- after about a week.  Hair towel-- when I remember to (I only use this towel for my hair and wash my hair twice a week).  Hand towels, dish towels, etc-- as needed.  Other bedding-- (blankets, comforters, etc)--- twice a year (Spring and fall).	episode_done:True

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE!- October 24	labels:can someone elaborate on the difference between the following 5 types of coats?: peacoat, duffle coat, trench coat, top coat, and overcoat?
text:A peacoat is a specific type of wool coat. It is derived from the military pea coat and will be double-breasted, if navy or charcoal wool (usually thick wool-nylon or pure wool), be thigh length,  tonal buttons, slightly curved collar iirc.   A duffle cost I can‚Äôt remember the specifics but I think has a good and toggle buttons? Could be wrong.  A trench is a raincoat, generally cotton or at least not wool, usually tan, doubtle breasted, belted, mid thigh or knee length.  Top coat and overcoat are generally pretty interchangeable iirc longer wool coats , single breasted, wool. A lot of variety under those terms but usually a top coat is intended to be worn over a suit iirc.   Different manufacturers will use a lot of these terms interchangeably which can be confusing.	labels:thank you for the detailed response!	episode_done:True

text:What inspired your passion/love for fashion?	labels:Honestly, it started as a teenager because I don‚Äôt see myself as physically attractive, and so I felt like I could never pull off a simple look like jeans and a t shirt to feel pretty. My peers were developing and looked cute in anything, even gym class and I knew I was plain and uninteresting. So I thought if I had a unique sense of fashion people would pay attention to my clothes as my ‚Äúappearance‚Äù rather than my looks.   Another piece was that growing up we couldn‚Äôt afford clothes for fashion (vs function) so I felt embarrassment when all my classmates had new clothes after the holidays and I was wearing the same thrifted clothes. Now that I have a solid income it‚Äôs something I am trying to cut back on, this compensating for my childhood complex lol.

text:Thoughts on ski / apres ski style?	labels:Skiing is a strenuous sport, often done in a dangerous alpine climate. I wear technical gear: bright loose waterproof jacket and pants for visibility and mobility, wicking warm base layers, balaclavas and goggles to protect my eyes and skin, a helmet, and a backpack or fanny pack with an emergency kit.   After skiing, I strip off the outer layers and walk around in uggs, tights, and turtleneck.   You know what? I 100% blend in. I don't look better or worse than the hundreds of other people who have just come down from the mountain. This is why people specifically wear bright colors. Your party will be able to identify you at a distance from the specific colors you're wearing.   I think ski/apres ski style is to skiing what cottage core is to farming/homesteading. It's an aesthetic for people who don't actually do it.   If you like the look and aren't interested in skiing, then look into some New England heritage preppy looks. The bean boots, scandi wool sweaters, thick stretchy stirrup pants, fluffy trimmed accessories, and parkas may appeal to you. Uniqlo has some cute stuff in their recent collab that has that cozy lux vibe. Moncler and Gorsuch are some OG European ski fashion wear companies. You could look into those for inspiration.   But definitely don't try to go skiing without a waterproof pant and jacket combo. You will have a terrible time, given how much you will likely fall. (Assuming that you're a beginner.)
text:Even as a fairly advanced skier I would still not go out without waterproof gear. Unless you‚Äôre close enough to the hills to only ski perfect weather, there‚Äôs a pretty good chance it will be snowing for at least some of your trips. I would hate to be shivering on a lift with wet gear!	labels:	episode_done:True

My "timeless classics" are pretty much just the experiments that worked - pieces that stayed in rotation or got so much use I needed to replace them with something similar later on, etc. I do keep on experimenting with little trends here and there, but it's also a nice comfort to have my classics around to mix in.	episode_done:True

text:No clue about winter wear. Please Help!	labels:Without knowing your personal style, I'd say at most for winter you only really want to invest in a nice jacket/coat and a scarf. You probably have everything else you could want for layering under it. - a nice shirt, undershirt and maybe a jumper.   Sizing wise stick with your usual size, as winter jackets are typically designed to be worn over something. You wont need to invest in something too extreme as you'll be walking the streets of Paris, not an expedition on the Artic.   Do spend a little more on the scarf though, as it can be a nice statement piece and you want it to last as well as feel nice.	episode_done:True

No. Does it make me happy? Yes. I have 2 keys on it. My first keychain was one shaped like an ear. I unleashed a beast after that.   I have some that I attach to my bags every so often and I like switching them out! Or add one or two to my lanyard. I say If you find one that‚Äôs a reasonable price that brings you joy, use it wherever you want. Even clip it to your wallet zipper. I use them more as charms than as keychains at this point basically.	episode_done:True

text:What's your fashion miracle?	labels:I used to wear small diamond earrings every day, and would put them in my wallet when I went to the gym after work. I got to work the next day and realized I forgot to put them back in after the gym, so I opened up my wallet and they were gone. I had made my usual morning stop for breakfast on the way to work, so I rushed to the food cart and looked all over the sidewalk but I couldn‚Äôt find them.  At least 1-2 weeks later I went to the same food cart for breakfast, looked down, and saw one diamond earring in the crack in the sidewalk. I looked more closely and there was the other one! The metal was chewed up (they were bezel set) so I had to get them repaired, but it was a lot cheaper than a new pair!   Definitely my #1 fashion (jewelry?) miracle.
text:That's incredible! I'm a notorious earring-loser, so I never wear nice ones. This gave me so much satisfaction ‚ù§	labels:It was insane that I found them! I still went to the same food cart pretty much every day after losing them, and I would half-heartedly look down, but I never thought I‚Äôd actually find them! This was in a big city by a bunch of office buildings, hospitals, etc., so a ton of foot traffic. I just assumed someone else found them and that was their lucky day, LOL.	episode_done:True

(a great example to me is Ralph Lauren creating the image of distilled American privilege, opportunity, and style by copying clothes from Brooks Brothers) Actual pieces I think fit the trend starter though:  Penny Loafers- GH Bass' Weejuns  Jeans- Levi's 501 Button Fly  Biker Jacket- Schott Perfecto  Oxford Shirt- Brooks Brothers button down	episode_done:True

It‚Äôs more about modeling before the 90s, how they were different in the 90s and George Michael (of course).

text:Brands that no longer live up to their name or quality	labels:kind of all of them? It seems like you have to pay pretty steep prices now to get the quality of clothes that mid-price mall brands had in the 1990s and early 2000s. It seems that most stores have switched to a model of selling poor quality pieces at huge markups with the expectation that they will sell most of the stock at clearance prices. The GAP used to have quality staples, and J Crew was "fancy." Now GAP is really the same quality as Old Navy, and don't know what J Crew is anymore. The quality has certainly dropped, but I also don't get what is up with the designs since you can't even get a reasonable women's suit there these days. Madewell is not made well. Anthropologie used to sell unique pieces with really good construction, now it's roughly the same as other fast fashion, though I do appreciate that they added petite and plus sizing and carry some high end brands too. Levi's main line is terrible now, and to get the heritage quality, you need to get the Made and Crafted line, which is really expensive!  I mostly shop secondhand because I can't afford the stuff I like. When buying new, I try to wait for sales and avoid buying anything "final sale" or with complicated returns unless I know it will work. Clothes that I used to get at Anthropologie, I now get from Sezane, Ulla Johnson, Doen, and Samantha Pleet. I started buying vintage jeans over Madewell/Levi's or expensive craft brands‚Äîmy 1980s Chic and Gitano jeans were probably sold at K-Mart/Target but are better quality than anything I have gotten from Madewell. I don't wear jeans/denim enough to justify craft denim prices. Patagonia is still very high quality technical wear; I just scope out the Tyler sport outlet and secondhand for deals. Shoes are hard because I don't like to get them secondhand. I switched from Adidas to Veja and Diemme for sneakers (you can find Diemme shoes for huge markdowns on Yoox during the winter and summer sales‚ÄîI don't think they are worth retail price).
text:Woah, thank you for this very detailed list of what you have experienced with your favorite clothing brands too! And for ideas of where to shop Anthropologie styles outside of the store.

text:[Inspiration] Jewelry	labels:Nice album OP. I've been into jewelry for some time. I've always liked bracelets and such, but lately I've been into rings. Just wish I had the guts (and budget) to start wearing them. It's one of these things that I like seeing others wear but I feel that wouldn't be able to pull of.  I might start to wear bracelets again and go from there.
text:I've been slowly building a collection of jewelry (mostly rings) and I think the trick is to have a couple of things minimum at all times. Wearing just one ring or bracelet alone feels a bit off to me, and I found that people challenged me less when I wore a couple of items as opposed to one.   At least, they stopped asking me if I was getting married any time soon.	labels:I think singular items can look off because people expect a wedding band or something with a single ring. Or it can kind of look like "i want to wear jewelery but I'm not sure if it's working for me". Its definitely better to wear multiple items and just go for it. Fortunately etsy can provide a relatively low cost of entry of one is curious but not sure	episode_done:True
text:Married dad-of-three wears skirts and heels to work ‚Äòbecause he can‚Äô	labels:Sorry, not really, but I'm not buying his excuse. There has to be some sort of sexual satisfaction he gets from doing this. I don't think he's trying to prove a point or break "gender norms". There has to be a deeper meaning to this than what he is explaining.
text:Of course.  But saying that here will get you downvoted into oblivion because gender norms that have evolved over millions of years did so for apparently no reason at all.	labels:Modern humans are like ~200k years young so "millions of years" is a a bit of a stretch.	episode_done:True

text:Married dad-of-three wears skirts and heels to work ‚Äòbecause he can‚Äô	labels:I mean good for him he's got the legs for it, but I almost wish this wasn't so newsworthy. Tons of people do this every day and it feels like the way this article was written still inappropriately enforces a gender binary.  > This very straight and married father man who is an engineer and loves cars totally breaks the rules by wearing clothes made for women and nobody else  Rather we could say  > Person puts on clothes that fit them, looks good  But that isn't such a gripping headline
text:I know what you mean and I agree. I don't particularly like the tone of the article, and the man himself is defensive in his instagram bio:   > I am just a straight, happily married guy that loves Porsches, beautiful women and incorporating high heels and skirts into my daily wardrobe.   In other words, "I like cars and hot women, so I'm manly. I just happen to like women's clothes too. But really, I'm manly." It reads like a masc gay guy trying to distance himself from "the fems".   Despite all of that, considering where most of the western world is regarding gender roles and expression, I think highlighting something like this is important because you don't typically see successful corporate boomer men in very obvious womenswear, especially at work. So even though there are plenty of issues here I think the visibility is important.	labels:I absolutely agree. And yet, I kind of get it.   As a guy who likes high heeled boots and silky shirts and racing/motorsports, makeup, musicals and woodworking and design and shooting... it‚Äôs almost like I‚Äôm two completely different people based on which of my hobbies/pastimes/etc. I‚Äôm currently engaged in. but I‚Äôm not. I can be selfish and like all these things. they can all inform part of my identity. The me thats wearing a track hoodie and a helmet and going sideways on the autocross course is the same me that‚Äôs wearing flowers and done up and belting the lyrics to frozen (frozen 2 because it‚Äôs better than the first and y‚Äôall can fight me) in the kitchen  (The fact that I only recently discovered I‚Äôm bi only adds to the contrast. oh hey look another thing I can‚Äôt choose)  But it‚Äôs a good reminder to be careful about *how* I remind people that I‚Äôm ‚Äúnot just X‚Äù, because it can come off exactly like you described.

Ideally I like to return in store, but I have found a lot of the stores near me have closed this year so that is a more annoying option.  I also hate that so few brands include shipping labels, I do not have printer so that means I need to go to Fedex to print, and then drop off at UPS or postoffice. It is annoying (printing at UPS is too expensive).

text:Women who have revamped your entire wardrobe ‚Äî how did that go? What is your advice for the rest of us?	labels:I've done so twice and the first time was a disaster.   I was trying to combine advice about "classic and timeless" pieces with a look based around an entirely different aesthetic, and it turned into a mess. I was still holding onto outdated assumptions about what was fashionable. I was trying to do too much at once. I have almost no pieces left from that year.  I am convinced that for 99% of people, "classic and timeless" is a scam. If you sew your own Victorian-style pieces, that's awesome. If you have a lot of time and money to spend a lot of time looking for the perfect 100% silk and cashmere pieces from different decades, that's awesome too. Otherwise, there's a good chance that you're in denial about a dated wardrobe. A better goal for most people is to get to a place where you can update with new pieces slowly - maybe 2-3 per year. I will be buying one new wool sweater this winter.  A good place to start is with what you already gravitate to in your daily life and your own closet. Imagine that you really want to go to work (or your favorite restaurant or to do something fun on the weekend, whatever you do often) tomorrow wearing something that makes you feel special and look your best, but you're going to be wearing it all day, so it needs to be pretty comfortable. Which outfit do you pull out?   In my own wardrobe, I can look through the outfits I passed by and say why - too casual (although sometimes those are perfect for another activity), I just don't love it and it would never be my first pick, too tight, too cheap-looking, not my style, too boring. It's easier to build around what you already like than to throw everything away and try to buy things based on an imaginary person that you've never actually been. Get rid of the things that you never gravitate toward, and see what's left. From there, you might need just a few more wish-list pieces to get that smaller wardrobe you love.	episode_done:True

text:How do you find your true style when you're surrounded by fast fashion?	labels:I came to that realization a few years ago too, I used to be really into Zara and H&M and all that bs. Basically I've found a few specific brands and stores I really like, (Reformation, Realisation Par, Anthro, and Rokit Vintage to name a few) that I follow, focusing on sustainable/vintage/consignment shops. I get a lot of ideas from social media, my friends (I'm lucky cause they're mostly art students so they're always looking cool), movies (old and new),  and also just people watching. Like if I'm on the subway and I see someone wearing a great coat, I think about what I like about the coat (fit, color, silhouette, etc.) then I might go thrifting and try to find a similar piece, or a piece that has an element of whatever I liked about the inspiration piece. I did a wardrobe overhaul recently and I started with basics I loved and just built my way from there. It's hard to avoid trends entirely, but if you focus on what you really are attracted to you're bound to find your style. There's a lot out there, just keep looking for it!	episode_done:True

I'm assuming you will be doing a lot of running around and trying to ensure everything's on schedule and things are organized so I would say comfort comes first. Maybe you can keep dressier shoes at your desk so you can wear sneakers while on the factory floor and change out of them if you have to meet clients.

text:What are people's experiences with clothing challenges like trying not to buy clothes for a year/only buying second hand? What are some tips?	labels:I try to do no buys but fashion is my number one hobby and now that I have a little disposable income I buy things that I love. Whenever no-buys happen they're not on purpose, I just happened to not have bought anything.   So, for me, approaching this less from an environmental impact and more from a "personal ethos" standpoint helps my spending habits. Do I admire the construction, the fabric, the style? Even if I don't wear this a lot will I be happy with it in my closet? When it's time to part with my clothes I sell them online and hope someone will buy it before taking it to goodwill because I want the garment to continue it's life (lol). I think by developing your own thoughts around spending and what you want, the sustainability and mindfulness will come naturally.   ALSO if you like Zara secondhand is the time to buy! I haven't shopped their in years but I do have some stuff that's really held up and looks good from them.

There's a spot on the far side of town that's a great for, like, furniture and winter coats, but I don't hit it often.  We had a Salvation Army but it was, like all the other Salvation Armies in the area, incredibly terrible and I'm not sad it's gone.  The best spot in my town is the Hospital Thrift store.  It gives serious 'little old lady' vibes, but also consistently has very wearable, quality items as well as cool, funky stuff that's nice to look at.  Bonus is that it's tiny  (Covfefe restrictions have pushed the store limit to 10,) so digging around doesn't take long and is well worth the effort.	episode_done:True

People will pretend like clothes from HM/ASOS will literally fall apart compared to Uniqlo but the truth is their both fast fashion brands and with the exception of sweaters and SOME jeans the construction is pretty comparable. You'll also find a lot more interesting options at HM/ASOS than you'll find at Uniqlo.  Zara is pretty affordable and has some interesting pieces/designer copy-cats but the quality is barely better than HM/ASOS and the prices are way higher.  AllSaints on sale is pretty good value preposition but they don't have very many colored garments. The pieces are interesting nonetheless however.  Like /u/TheVirt said J. Crew on sale is great too, albeit a bit lacking in the interesting piece department.  Some other individual brands around that price-point would be Carhartt WIP, Alpha Industries, and The North Face (if you don't mind the branding.)   Then moving up you could start looking at multi-brand clothiers like Mr. Porter, SSENSE, End Clothing, etc. for more options and brand ideas.  The secondhand market with Grailed, Poshmark (Full disclosure: I have no experience with Poshmark, only Grailed) etc. isn't bad either if you have the time to sort through and do your own research on brands.	labels:	episode_done:True

More coherent words are escaping me, but many (though not all) of these pictures have cracked or peeling paint, geometric patterns in the wood floor boards/cement tiles/bricks which show beautiful but non-homogenous aging. Very wabi-sabi, though not in the meaning of worn out clothes as it is often interpreted here.   I recognize this is some fresh word salad, hopefully I conveyed the idea though!

text:Do you follow the conventional rules around "flattering your figure?"	labels:I've written about this before, but as someone who is 5'2 on a good day, I have stopped giving a shit about looking "longer and leaner."  In fact, I reject the idea that I should want to look taller. Maybe all those 5'7 women should be taking advice on how to make their legs look as stubby as mine. <--Obviously a joke but to make a point. How stupid is it that I should feel like my natural body is something to correct?  I'm an old woman, lol, and over the course of my life I have never found that my stubby legs (that I was once self-conscious about) have kept me from career advancement or from finding people who thought I was beautiful and wanted to have sex with me, so what's the freaking problem?  Fuck conventional figure flattery.  That being said, of course there are things I think look better on me than other things and I tend to wear the things I think look better in ways I think look better most of the time.  Except when the comfort or beauty of a garment is so outstanding it overrules that.  Thanks for coming to my TED talk.  There are cookies on the table in the back.
text:So happy to hear this expressed so well.  I am short.  I've been, at various times, self conscious about it & listened to the seemingly universally accepted notion that it is desirable to look taller.  Now, the idea that taller is objectively better is a crap idea I bought into mindlessly.  I'm embracing my height and rebelling against choosing my clothes with the aim of looking taller.  I will buy what I like and what I think looks good.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What do you get tailored?	labels:I started getting my clothes tailored last year and the difference is incredible. Looked like I lost a ton of weight and I gained so many compliments on my clothes. It makes cheap clothing (but well made) look expensive!

text:When to start saving clothes for your children?	labels:When to start saving clothes for your children?   Never. You don't know:   1. If you'll have children 2. If you'll have a girl or and trans child who would find it appropriate to wear your clothes 3. If they'll even have the same fashion sense as you 4. If they will be the same size as you 5. If your clothes will hold up to the ravages of time   I come from a family of hoarders. I have some hoarding tendencies of my own which I'm dealing with. I'm also in the midst of cleaning out my mum's home after she died almost 2 years ago. I go over every weekend and spend a few hours clearing out her stuff. I've been doing this for going on 18 months. I've spent hundreds of dollars trucking stuff to the dump. I learned the hard way that it's not worth holding onto stuff, *just in case*.  My mother held onto every piece of baby clothing and toddler and children's and a lot of teen clothing I wore. And all of her clothes. And all of my grandmother's clothes. And all of my brothers and sisters and father's clothes. And some of her sister's stuff, too. And you know what it looks like now? Most of it has disintegrated, some chewed up by mice, others damaged by moths, and a lot damaged by mold. Anything that hasn't been destroyed by time has gone to charity. I love my mother, and I have memories from my mother, I don't need her moth-eaten, moldy, brittle leather jacket from 50 years ago. And neither do your kids. Give your stuff away to charity to people who need it now, and don't leave behind boxes of crap for your kids to have to deal with after you're dead. Cleaning out my mother's home is teaching me to be a minimalist.    Put money aside, and use it to buy things your child actually wants. And donate your unwanted clothes to charity to people who need it now.   e: don't even get me started on toys, old school work, books, records, VHS tapes...    e: This is coming from a 41 year old who never had kids (even though she always thought she would).

Buying clothes is much better when you know your measurements, especially online shopping. Wearing clothes that fit right helps my self confidence a lot. For his build a tailored/athletic/muscle fit would probably fit best (talking about shirts), possibly a slim fit depending on the brand and the size chart for it.   I‚Äôd recommend learning his measurements because finding what he likes and what works best for him will help him develop his own style. It also makes online shopping so much easier.

text:What to do when nothing fits you properly?	labels:Other people have covered the main points- find fashion bloggers or icons that look like you; buy from companies where people post reviews with pictures, so you can see how it looks on someone with a similar body type; don't be intimidated to go to a tailor, or tailor your own clothes (youtube has plenty of tutorials on how to do basic alterations!).  Please don't take this as intending to trivialize your struggles, but rather an effort to offer some validation: off the rack clothes don't really fit *most* people well. I have friends of all different body types and sizes, and we *all* struggle to find clothes that work for us off the rack. So please know that you're not having trouble because your body is somehow uniquely unsuitable for clothes. It's because, quite frankly, *most* clothing is badly cut and designed. Most clothing sucks. Clothing manufacturers, especially since the 2008 recessions (i.e. most of your life), have been making clothing that just gets weirder and boxier and less flattering with every passing year. It's almost impossible to find things that fit anyone (in the sense of being flattering), because they are made to fit everyone (in the sense of doing the bare minimum of technically covering the body). Instead of manufacturing clothes to fit a human body, with all its curves and variations, it's *way* cheaper and easier to sew a couple rectangles together and call it a shirt. And we don't really have better options, so we buy it, so they keep making it. And it may feel like other people don't struggle with this, but you're not seeing them in the dressing rooms or looking through their closets in the morning. You're seeing them out and about, or on social media, where everything is carefully clipped and styled, staged to look perfect and effortless.	episode_done:True
text:BoF: J. Crew's New CEO has a Survival Plan: Edit out the Ugly	labels:i just feel like their price points are so high and the quality can be kind of mediocre. they‚Äôre stuck in a weird place where their pricing is too expensive for the average consumer who‚Äôs trained to expect bargains and too cheap for someone who buys luxury or higher end pieces.   even with their random extra 50% off sales, it‚Äôs still above what people expect to pay. but then again, madewell is thriving. (though i think that has more to do with being able to capture an on-trend aesthetic.)
text:The wildest thing to me is that Madewell has really consistent sizing and I'm able to order online with confidence about what will fit. I have ordered a bunch of things and haven't needed to return or exchange a single one. By the end of last year, J. Crew was the most inconsistent sizing of any brand I think I've ever encountered. I could take 15 items of the same size into a dressing room and all 15 of them would fit like shit in totally different ways. It means online shopping is essentially unavailable to me - in this economy, no less. They've maintained those price points while spiraling out re: their supply chain.	labels:I feel like JCrew *used* to be more consistent. I used to have faith that a size 6 Perfect Shirt was, indeed, a perfect fit for me. I owned three of them in white alone. That hasn't been the case in recent years, and it's a shame.   Besides inconsistent fit, there's also just been some bizarre merchandizing decisions. Last March, right before all this (gestures at 2020) went down, I went into a JCrew looking for work pants. I did not find a *single pair of full length pants.* I mean, I can understand gearing up for spring, but ... no pants? at all? Some decisions just don't make sense.
text:Yeah, I went in there looking for a classic, flattering suit a couple of years ago, which was something they used to do really well, and they didn‚Äôt have a single normal suit.

text:Are our ideas about what looks ‚Äúdated‚Äù on either ourselves or others affected by or correlated with our age?	labels:>Do you think there‚Äôs an age where the concept of what looks ‚Äúdated‚Äù changes? This has been on my mind a lot and a comment in the ‚Äúwhat will be obsolete‚Äù thread played into it - someone said that skinny jeans will vanish... except on women around or over 40.  Some women kind of freeze their style in their 30s or even 20s. I am not sure why though. But I have friends who are like fussy children eating, they want just this or that precise cut. I think it is fun to try stuff just to try it out but no they want precise duplicates or very similar items to what they had. I think a lot of women can kind of research "flattering" for their body type or coloring (that horrible season theory...) and then it is like they graduated it, no more thinking about it, they stick to the rules they know. With a friend of mine it is massive list. I try to not push things at people, but once it was fun to see her revelation that OK, yes, horizontal stripes do look good on her (and she bought it and wore it lots) just because she thought she knew she was too heavy to wear stripes (no.... depends width, cut but it can look very nice).  I think datedness is a thing in general for every item, everything kind of is in an environment and we can not even see details which seem so obvious and only right way to do something but which will change in a few years. But unless something is too extreme, often there is ways to wear different waist lines, different pant width or hemlines, different things more timelessly. It helps though if the whole outfit is blended, if the shoes or bag or other pieces are more modern...  Getting a piece in a new trend, and combining it with older pieces can produce a lot of very different "new" right-now outfits.	episode_done:True

I already have the outfit, but I'm on a weight loss journey (steady throughout the past two months, 5 lbs left to lose) and I need to lose 3 lbs for the skirt not to look awkward with my slight tummy bulge when I'm eating huge meals.  I do, however, wear a lot of interesting clothes just for when I'm out shopping or even having to go to the doctor. I'm doing a lot of experimentation with style now that no people of any importance to me whatsoever are gonna see me, and I can try out shoes with different heels and clothes with different fit, wear it throughout the day, and then know if it works for my lifestyle or not. I realized that a glitter top is see-through in some kinds of lighting, and that the cleavage on my wrap top is getting looser throughout the day, revealing more than I would like, etc. Also buying heel buffers for shoes I have never worn because they give me blisters, and wearing new leather shoes around the house to break them in, etc.	episode_done:True

I ordered a dress and a top, both are 100% cotton, well constructed, and fit me like they were made for me (because they were).   The one drawback is it took about 6 weeks from order to arrival, but I actually think that‚Äôs pretty quick for something that was made to order and then shipped from India to the US.

text:How do your clothes wear out?	labels:For me, it‚Äôs typically the elasticity of fabrics start to give and the items no longer fit correctly or if it‚Äôs a bottom, they no longer ‚Äústay up‚Äù. This usually happens with leggings or panties after about 5 or more years of regular wear with caring for the items properly.  I also had a faux leather jacket wear out after 6 years of regular wear. The faux leather ended up ‚Äúpeeling off‚Äù or something like that.
text:Yeah, it's the elastic that gives out, and returns to it's original petroleum state.   I don't buy artificial fibres, because of environmental reasons, but almost all cotton clothing will include 2-5% spandex, and that's the first thing that goes.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Who else has sensory issues that has figured out ways to not dress boring?	labels:I can't for the life of me handle tight clothing. I'm not diagnosed with adhd but two gps have independently brought up the possibility and I'll look into it with a specialist soon.  I can't handle tights, tight long sleeves, pantyhose, or (and they're the worst ever) skinny trousers, especially jeans. Luckily, with my awkward proportions, almost all clothes that fit me are either too wide, too short (I just don't go for those), or made for boys. So I just go with slightly oversized most of the time. I vary between androgynous styles with inspiration from malefashionadvice or old fashioned looking, almost frumpy dresses, or a combination of a wide, drapy blouse and a flowing wide skirt. The drawback is that I can't really be feminine in winter because tights and leggings are off the table for me and I'd be too cold with bare shins.   That gives me a decent amount of variation! So it might be worth checking men's fashion if you're similar to me, or going for retro/vintage style blouses, skirts, and dresses.	episode_done:True
text:For the parents of girls	labels:Mom of two little girls - 4 years old and 20 months old. The four year old dresses herself in whatever she wants.

She hates it when I ask her to wear something specific (like for a holiday) so I just try to buy special outfits we will both love. I let her pick out some of what I buy for her (give her some options to pick from). We shop mostly online so it‚Äôs easy for me to have some control over what she can choose.   The 20 month old pretty much wears hand me downs lol and I mostly pick what she wears but she‚Äôs starting to prefer to select herself (she‚Äôll tell me ‚Äúpick dress‚Äù in the morning to tell me she wants to choose a dress). I will let her pick her clothes more and more as she becomes more independent.   I imagine over time my girls will start to put together more and more fashionable outfits as they become more aware of style and what their peers are wearing. I will always let them choose for themselves and only intervene when what they want to wear is truly inappropriate for some reason. And even then I will continue to give them options for alternatives and let them choose. It‚Äôs their body after all!	episode_done:True
text:Help needed for buying jeans online! All advice is welcome!	labels:1. check the material content. If you're looking for the thicker, heavy duty jean with no stretch look, always look at "materials and care" to check fabric content. You want it to be 100% cotton. Cheap options: Zara, H&M, Banana Republic (on sale) and more pricey: Levi's & everlane 2. For skinny jeans you probably want some with some stretch I think 90-95% cotton? (same retailers as above) 3. ALWAYS check to see what shipping/return policy is by digging around the website. Most retailers will offer free shipping over $50 which you can easily hit when buying jeans. ALWAYS!!! check what the return options are. Some will say "free returns" but the fine print will read "but return shipping will be deducted from your refund" If you don't hit the free shipping requirement just buy something you know you're going to return.  4. don't be afraid to buy sizes below and above your normal size! The more you buy the more you'll become familiar with different brands, their fit, and sizing!	episode_done:True

text:Shinies From the Past - or, What to do with Gifts from Past Relationships?	labels:Your wounds may still be fresh; even if it was a mutual breakup there are lingering emotions.   This is a different take, but why not put it in storage for a little while until you can heal?  If you really like the jewelry in an aesthetic sense there is no reason to get rid of it. When my first real boyfriend and I broke up (mutual but messy) I put some gifts he gave me in my memory box and didn't touch it for years. More than enough time has passed for those emotions to mellow and now I can look at those memories as something sweet and valuable in my past without any romantic connotations.
text:I actually have moved on quite fully, and am happily involved in a new relationship but do like that idea of putting it away for a while to see if it helps with the detachment! There are two pieces that I do really love, but didn't wear frequently and so now feels a little weird to wear around my new partner. I've had the pieces put away for a while already, so may just continue to leave them until more time has passed!	labels:	episode_done:True

Does anyone have any stylish but functional suggestions? For the time being I've been unhinging my jaw like a snake and fitting everything down my gullet till I need it, but space is limited and I'd like to be able to carry a few more essentials. I really am a purse person.

text:How do your clothes wear out?	labels:For me, it‚Äôs typically the elasticity of fabrics start to give and the items no longer fit correctly or if it‚Äôs a bottom, they no longer ‚Äústay up‚Äù. This usually happens with leggings or panties after about 5 or more years of regular wear with caring for the items properly.  I also had a faux leather jacket wear out after 6 years of regular wear. The faux leather ended up ‚Äúpeeling off‚Äù or something like that.
text:This reminds me of these cheap leather boots I had. I had them for years but always forgot about them and one day I needed something to match an outfit for an event and the boots came to mind. Wrong move... The leather looked okay but once they creased and stretched while walking, the whole thing started peeling off. Thankfully, it was dark at the event and even if somebody noticed, nobody said anything... The boots ended up giving me permanent injury on a specific spot on my foot afterwards bc they turned out to be very painful to walk in, though.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Remote Business Casual	labels:I like to wear sweaters, especially turtlenecks because they're comfy but can also look dressy if I'm wearing jewelry. For warmer days I like high necked nice t shirts that can translate as more professional. The fitted H&M ones are my favorite.	episode_done:True
text:Anyone have a job that requires you to wear "work clothes" (nursing, trades, etc.)? What is your off-duty wardrobe like?	labels:I ride horses professionally and manage a boarding facility, so my daily wear has to be appropriate for riding 8 horses a day (so breeches, knee high socks, athletic shirts), getting dirty (mud boots, overclothes I don't much care about), and staying warm/dry (seven billion layers of hobo coats). Unfortunately, my personal style is more of a mix of cottagecore/Edwardian/grungy Audrey Hepburn, which as you can imagine has absolutely no place whatsoever in my day to day life. I am also a compulsive clothes hoarder (screw you, Goodwill and thrift shopping!)  &#x200B;  I got sick and tired of seeing all these beautiful clothes in my closets that I *never* wore, so I purged it completely. I have two to three outfits for every occasion, two pairs of going - out jeans, and one pair of black heels now, with the ability to mix and match in between. Since I never really go anywhere, I always feel like I'm wearing something new when I do! Most of my pieces are more or less "timeless styles," and then I try and get one new thing every season to keep my wardrobe up with the times. But I have a rule that every time I buy a new thing, I have to throw one item out, which helps with the clothes hoarding!   &#x200B;  Luckily, I have some room for fashion in my work wear. I try and get trendy colored breeches in earth tones, find complementary shirts and jackets, cool socks, etc. I also have the awesome opportunity to color coordinate with my horse *and* his tack, which most people can't say, so I'll take that over being truly fashionable any day! (Did you guys know it's actually pretty difficult to pick a color scheme that also complements the exact shade of your horses coat properly? It's hard enough to determine whether humans are cool or warm or whatever....)	episode_done:True

text:Fall Fit Battle - Final Four - Discussion	labels:Hey, who forgot to tell /u/Rariora about the textured gray trousers?  \--> /u/8888plasma <-- v. /u/Rariora \-- neither fit really surprised me. Maybe I've just seen enough of this battle for now. Like I said, with /u/Rariora, I like the long coat over interesting pants, but I think it came out better last time. And I'm not in love with the black-forward color scheme here. Plasma's look is also more tame than usual, no crazy colors, but the first background was... cheating, really. The long cardigan worked. And is that all color 8? And the scarf being worn asymmetrically like that is a plus for me. Tame, overall, but... really solid.  \--> /u/ngoknows <-- v. /u/chunsak \-- I'd say NGO ahs the most interesting fit here, for me, with the big, fun, scarf. I like the asymmetry in the first photo... Really solid fit. Oh, and I love the detail shot! Chunsak... Also solid, but doesn't stir anyting up in me, personally. I can see how cord, flannel and donegal in this combination might excite some of you, but for me... eh.  Overall... I expect something crazier next round. Don't pull any punches for the finals.

text:How have you changed your style and/or shopping habits after your body has changed?	labels:I'll add my 2 cents as someone that went through a big weight change about 4 years ago and how I've accepted/adjusted to it.  Until about 35, I weighed 110 and my concerns were always about trying to add curves with clothes since I had no butt and a flat chest.    A few lifestyle changes...I quit smoking!  I started working from home (so similar to what people are experiencing now) and I went on birth control.  All those factors together lead to a 50lb weight gain in about 6-8 months.    At first I didn't believe what my clothes were telling me.  I thought oh these jeans must have shrunk or those always ran small.  I was still cramming myself into size small or extra small tops because it was all I had ever worn.  Then one day I saw my own reflection in a window and thought "that poor girl needs to just go up a size or two" and then I realized it was me.  I used to love body hugging clothes like close fitting turtlenecks but now they just accentuate the parts of me I don't like.  I've switched to flowy tops and sweaters.  I used to avoid maxi dresses if I couldn't wear a push up bra because they made me look sooo flat chested.  Now I love them and its so nice not worrying about bra straps or a strapless constantly sliding down.    The biggest obstacle for me has been to stop fixating on the size on the label and just get the size that looks and fits the best.  I also was really motivated to lose weight for a little while and still bought the smaller sizes even if I could barely get in to them.  I lost a little of what I gained but I think my body is just happier at the heavier weight.  I think I look better too but it was hard giving up the "I'm the skinny girl" identity I had for so long.	episode_done:True
text:Hats and how to wear them	labels:Not a lot of people still wear hats, but I keep hearing that many people *wish* they were still stylish to wear... so please feel free to help make hats fashionable again!  Typical etiquette for hat wearing is that if it's a very small decorative hat--something that stays close to the head--you may wear it indoors, but if it's a larger hat, you take it off indoors.  With something like a cloche or beret, which isn't exactly tiny but also isn't oppressively huge, it follows nearly the same rules as a coat:  If you're just popping by on an errand, it's fine to keep it on, but if you're planning to stay a while, you should take it off.  This is especially true if you're visiting a place of hospitality--a friend or relative's home, for example, or a restaurant--where somebody is offering comfort and relaxation, keeping your hat/coat on might be seen as a rejection of their hospitality.

text:For the parents of girls	labels:My daughter is two and while she loves helping dress me (I'll ask her what colour I should wear today and she'll have VERY firm opinions about that), she's still utterly indifferent to dressing herself and prefers to run around naked XD         I absolutely HATED how I was dressed as a kid (lots of home made clothes in my grandma's very questionable fabric choices... the clothes were cute, the fabric would be like orange and purple plaid or garish green and gold stripes (why grandma, WHY????), so I have a lot of name brand clothes for my daughter that I got second hand (gap, tommy Hilfiger, tea collection, persnickety, etc.) for like $2-5 a piece (FB marketplace is really good in my area - pre-covid, people would just invite you into their front hallways, drop bins of nearly new toddler and baby clothes in front of you, and then let you rifle through them and then charge you a flat price for each item you picked.  Found so much good stuff that way.)      I'm very much going to let her develop her own style and experiment from as early as she wants.  As long as she is weather appropriate, I plan on taking a supportive, hands off approach once she actually shows interest.    She has definite fit preferences now though (when I do dress her, leggings are a must - no jeans or wide legged pants).  She also hates long sleeves.	episode_done:True
text:Best way to buy clothes locally?	labels:I‚Äôm in the U.K. and when not in lockdown, I get most of my clothes from the local dress agency (consignment store) and charity shops. My SIL has also had great look on local Facebook groups. They can be a bit hit or miss as she often gets bags with a selection of things in the same size & some items might not to be her liking, but she just reposts those for someone else to enjoy. The Facebook groups are more beneficial for kids clothes though I think.
text:Local dress agency?! Is there a name I could google?	labels:It depends where you are based - I‚Äôd perhaps just try ‚Äúdress agency near me‚Äù and see what results you get.

text:FAQ: When shopping on a budget, what items have the highest point at which they reach diminishing returns?	labels:In my experience, lower quality at lower price points is most noticeable for outerwear, footwear, or knits (I guess because they all serve a functional purpose) and spending more tends to lead to a more noticeable improvement in quality up to a certain point. That's painting with a broad brush though... leather dress shoes and boots scale much better than sneakers or sandals, where mid-range options are going to be good enough for most people.  T-shirts, dress shirts, denim, and accessories in low-to-mid-range are generally good enough from a quality perspective IMO and I've only really paid more in those categories for a design I like rather than because I think I'm getting something higher quality. There's nothing wrong IMO with buying something because you like the way it looks even if a similar quality alternative exists at a lower price, but that's harder to do if you're shopping on a budget.  I'll also add that for all of the above, your dollar goes a lot farther if you're willing to shop used. Sites like Ebay, Grailed, reddit/styleforum B/S/T threads, etc. have made it a lot easier to buy preowned clothes without having to set foot into a thrift store.  TL;DR When shopping on a budget I'd focus first on having a high quality pair of shoes and jacket. Consider buying used clothes to stretch your budget further.

text:It did directly compare it to American slavery, but yeah, I get your point. I guess they do that since when most people hear slavery they think of chattel slavery, which was incredibly brutal. What's happening now is a bit more iffy. Not only is it a lot less brutal, people aren't really owned 24/7, like a slave.

So, instead of looking at myself and judging myself and fantasizing about who I could be in those clothes... I saw my list and the clothes below it. It made things much easier from an emotional standpoint.  My list went something like this:  * You can only wear one pair of pants at a time. (Which applies to all garments but I like the groundedness of pants as the representative of all clothes.)  * You are a stylish and fashionable person no matter what you wear.  * You would rather have the money.  * You enjoy spending time on maintenance, but that does not include organizing your storage!  If I did this exercise again today, I would also include:  * If you don't want to wear it right now, you probably will never want to wear it. (Speaking to emotional reaction to clothes, not situational factors like working from home, etc.)  * If you don't want to mend it or alter it, that might be because you don't actually want to wear it.	episode_done:True

text:Does anyone have a "uniform"?	labels:I often buy multiples of items I love. I bought several of the same cardigan after I realized that I wore it more than any other sweater I owned. It's great!  Another thing I do is, when I see an item I like, I mentally run through my closet and see if it will mesh with what I already own. If it works, I get it. If I'd have to buy several new items to make it work, I don't. For this reason, I don't own many t-shirts, but I do own lots of sweaters and dresses.

text:Anyone else feeling incredibly disconnected from the 'fashion world'?	labels:I like Lauren Messiah, she's a fashion stylist and gives good tips on how to find your personal style, different style types, how to use Pinterest as tool to find your style etc.   I mostly watch runway shows and take inspiration from them- how to wear a white shirt in unique ways, how to wear a purple skirt, etc. They are the most creative imo.  Fashion is personal to me, I have no interest in the mainstream media that publicises a certain trend.	episode_done:True
text:What are your 2021 Fashion / Style Goals?	labels:I‚Äôm generally happy with my wardrobe but I simply have too much - too much clothing, too many shoes, too many bags, etc. It‚Äôs getting to be overwhelming. I would like to try to do a low/no buy year to keep me from accumulating more, while simultaneously trying to declutter what I already have. If I do make purchases I want to think about them long and hard, and really justify why I need them. I also want the item to be perfect if I‚Äôm going to buy it - I have a bad habit of buying things that are ¬´¬†good enough¬†¬ª in the pursuit of what I really want and that‚Äôs definitely contributed to my overflowing wardrobe. No more settling for ¬´¬†good enough¬†¬ª, it‚Äôs a waste of money & close space!	episode_done:True

What are some tips?	labels:I'm doing a no-buy year (exception being things like sports bras or replacements for things that are no longer wearable), and the biggest help to me was unsubscribing from ALL marketing emails. Removing those updates from brands and sales and such was helpful, especially since we're so inundated with online marketing nowadays.

I would be interested in a brand that offers higher quality finishings.	episode_done:True
text:Does anyone else use a ‚Äúformula‚Äù to create their outfits?	labels:Some of mine in no particular order; I don't think about it all the time but my dressing habits are based around this:   * No more than 3 colours (I don't wear much black and have a lot of different neutrals, so I have to be aware of this). * Try to have something more interesting than just a crew neck sweater + pants. I am so guilty of falling into this when I get lazy.  * Don't wear the same colour pants and coat. People can probably pull this off no problem but it is something I avoid for some reason.  * Like someone else said, for tops and bottoms no tight/tight or loose/loose. I just don't feel comfortable that way. I feel better when I emphasize either my waist or my hips.  * Only wear 1 uncomfortable item at a time. Ideally you would have no uncomfortable items but unfortunately I have a few pieces that I am not willing to get rid of. If I wear them all at once it's like I am crawling in my own skin, so I try to be aware of this when I dress to leave the house.	episode_done:True

text:Let's talk the impact of fragrance on perception of style! How much does a person's fragrance affect your impression of them? Do you choose perfume with this in mind? What are some of your favourites?	labels:There's only one person who wears a perfume I don't mind, and that's a woman in my office who makes her own perfume. The first version was giving one of the people in our office headaches, so she changed up the components and that solved that problem. For me, most perfumes trigger headaches at best, and migraines at worst, so I avoid people who wear perfume. It seems like perfume has become less prevalent in recent years, and as far as I'm concerned I'm thrilled about that since it's difficult to avoid scents as a health trigger.	episode_done:True
text:How to find the confidence to wear clothes you like?	labels:For light colored clothes:  - Persil laundry detergent. It‚Äôs gotten stains out of things that I never thought possible - Keep a few Clorox wipes or a tide pen in your bag for random spots that may occur  - Carry a scarf in your bag to sit on, I always do regardless of what color my pants are  With new clothes, I‚Äôll wear them around the house for a bit to get comfortable in them & make any adjustments to the outfit. IMO it‚Äôs a great time to listen to music, maybe have a drink/tea, relax, and enjoy the process. Invoke the feeling of getting ready for a Friday night out with your best friends.   Then it‚Äôs time to for the outside world. My lizard brain chose these beautiful clothes, it‚Äôs time to embrace them.

I wanted to see which are not really used,  which I must change a bit (maybe dye it a different colour, maybe get it resewn) and what small purchases would really make a huge difference in my wardrobe (a belt, a skin coloures tshirt, a scarf in a certain colour etc) It made me realize I have more than enought cool outfits to last me a whole season, eventhough my wardrobe is not big at all.	episode_done:True

text:Quick tips to look UN-polished?	labels:The key is actually just learning how to create FABULOUS casual outfits rather than tryin to dull down a dressy outfit. Instead of starting from a place of Dressiness, start with Casual then work on making it the NICEST version of casual possible.    I like to wear jeans and loafers and then some gold earrings, a small scarf, a blazer and maybe a necklace. Where I live even that can be too fancy. So if I see its over the top, I just whip off the scarf and blazer, wipe the lipstick off a little and then I'm looking really cute casual in a t-shirt and jeans.     Overly styled hair and makeup is one thing I notice older women do that "ruins" a casual outfit. The hair is often too stiff and done and the makeup too "nice". So I think having a really pretty, casual go-to hair and makeup routine is important.	episode_done:True

text:You know how audiophiles all make jokes about how meaningless the terms used to describe sound are because sound is so hard to define in that way? Same thing here, ‚Äúwarm‚Äù and ‚Äúcold‚Äù are very loose terms that probably mean something a little different to everyone.   I can see the argument for grey and cream being cold, brown can be warm or cold depending on the shade, not sure if I‚Äôd agree with black.	labels:Welllll... he answered me on instagram, and it seems like he *was* talking about "cool" in the more common sense, but also meant to imply unsaturated / whatever, and that part was more important...

text:How much of your income do you spend on average in clothes every month?	labels:When I was a student, I did buy quite a lot of fast fashion (e.g. Primark) and high street items, particularly when there was a good sale on. I enjoyed it and was exploring my style, and it was all balanced by not spending as much on nights out, drinking and takeaways.  Once I started working, I divided up my money into buckets: monthly fun money (¬£100) that can roll up, monthly luxury savings money (¬£100) that would accumulate until I could afford the ¬£¬£¬£ item I wanted, monthly travel/experience money budget that would also accumulate, general bills and the rest into savings. Ultimately these numbers are arbitrary and was the way that allowed me to splurge sensibly whilst saving, guilt free.   Remember that you can always earn more money so don't be too hard on yourself, but also learn how to be fiscally responsible! It's a balance and learning experience for sure, and will change as life happens (*cough* Covid *cough*).	episode_done:True
text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - January 20, 2021	labels:I love my dickies 874 pants. As a dude with an odd shape, big ass and thighs while having short legs, they fit really well without being too loose.      My only problem is I feel ethically wrong about wearing these pants, as they're made of 65% polyester, and washing them releases microplastics into the water. I'm trying to move my wardrobe, eventually, to being mostly if not exclusively organic materials like cotton and wool.     Does anyone know of any pants/work pants that have a similar fit to them, but might not use as much polyester/are 100% cotton?

The pants I have aren‚Äôt very comfortable for rolling around in, or sitting casually (raw denim, tucked in shirt, etc) - to which at this party there will be food and drink, and lots of floor space to sit or lay (they have no furniture, and people usually just sit on the floor). Pretty casual, however I don‚Äôt want to look like a slob or over dress.

I wonder if they're also seriously talking about contingency plans for the sake of reduction of waste - if anything should forecast a major drop in sales (for any reason) are they thinking about how they can stop the machine, or is the massive waste of fashion product just kind of collateral damage to them due to the entrenched nature of the current model of the industry.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:What‚Äôs on everyone‚Äôs Black Friday wishlists?	labels:It's mostly shoes and bags for me this year‚Äîand mostly secondhand. This season's trends have been too utilitarian for my tastes.  I've already bought a few sale things from & Other Stories (a black velvet bag with gold beading, and a cream blouse with a pointy collar and a million little buttons), and a long-coveted Little Liffner bag in sky blue (from TheRealReal).  Here's my current wishlist, though:  * a pink alpaca sweater in a delicate knit * black knee-high leather boots with a low block heel (and ideally a square-ish toe) * a little cropped boucle or tweed jacket, but with a collar (so hard to find!) * a small, cherry red leather shoulder bag to replace a worn-out one * black sheer tights of decent quality * classic, minimal sneakers: one pair in red leather, another in black leather with white soles * inexplicably, a black pillbox hat (I have never worn hats but am suddenly feeling an urge)	episode_done:True
text:How to avoid looking older with your clothing??	labels:I think everyone looks back on their teenage years as being super cringy... not because of our style but because the fashion itself from 10, 15 or 20 years ago *can seem* really awful when we look back. 20 years ago, I was 15. I look at what teenagers wear today and I'm like "damn.... I wish I'd had that sense of style." But I did, just in my time. We wore what we wore back then because it was a great way to help us explore, create, and share our identities in the sense of a larger concept of style. But those styles change, evolve, come back around, and disappear again over time. I think I looked ridiculous when I was 15, but back then, I was cool as hell!  Honor your own sense of style and what makes you feel comfortable, happy, and the most authentic expression of who you are. Those may all change over time, but enjoy the moment you're in.  I also had a big vintage clothing phase when I was around your age and perhaps my favorite thing was hitting the local thrift store and altering my finds to fit my size and style. My senior prom dress was actually 3 vintage gowns that I'd found and spliced together. Even today I would say that about a third of my wardrobe is vintage and thrift. The best way to wear vintage and thrift I would say is to learn how to make little alterations like hemming, changing buttons, adding or removing darts, or dyeing. I loved making things my own in simple, little ways.	episode_done:True

For one-off more specialist purchases, I start looking early and just accept it's going to take a while before I buy what I need.

VC, session and twilight are all great options that look good and feel good running and at half the cost. Still pricey but compared to other high end tunning shorts by nike or Adidas they are comparable   But you can also get great shorts for $20 by new balance, brooks, nike, adidas, saucony and so on that are great comfortable and look decent.

text:Do you follow the conventional rules around "flattering your figure?"	labels:I've written about this before, but as someone who is 5'2 on a good day, I have stopped giving a shit about looking "longer and leaner."  In fact, I reject the idea that I should want to look taller. Maybe all those 5'7 women should be taking advice on how to make their legs look as stubby as mine. <--Obviously a joke but to make a point. How stupid is it that I should feel like my natural body is something to correct?  I'm an old woman, lol, and over the course of my life I have never found that my stubby legs (that I was once self-conscious about) have kept me from career advancement or from finding people who thought I was beautiful and wanted to have sex with me, so what's the freaking problem?  Fuck conventional figure flattery.  That being said, of course there are things I think look better on me than other things and I tend to wear the things I think look better in ways I think look better most of the time.  Except when the comfort or beauty of a garment is so outstanding it overrules that.  Thanks for coming to my TED talk.  There are cookies on the table in the back.
text:Best comment here.  But really, I can just head my mom telling me that my outfit is ‚Äúfigure flattering‚Äù as the greatest compliment...  I used to abide by that idea 100 percent when I had no confidence and felt I needed to try to look as skinny as possible - because that‚Äôs what figure flattering means. F that. I still pick out clothes I like on my body, but don‚Äôt worry about it as much if it doesn‚Äôt elongate my legs but it‚Äôs a kickass piece!	labels:	episode_done:True

I seriously loved polyvore... it was such a fun way to see not only outfits that I could ostensibly purchase and put together in real life, but fantasy outfits as well... man.

text:Hot Southern Gothic Summer / Inspo album / Because we needed another for 2021!	labels:Oh lord. As a Southerner these clothes make me feel very hot! I‚Äôm a fan of poet/bishop style tops in gauze, cottons and linen. Airy high waisted skirts. Stetson‚Äôs Santa Monica straw fedora. Chantilly lace. Painted hand fans. White slip dresses in the vein of Liz Taylor in Cat on a Hot Tin Roof. And the film Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil.
text:Honestly, it‚Äôs so hot and humid down here (south Louisiana) in summer that mostly all anyone ever wears are tank tops and shorts. I can‚Äôt imagine wearing anything with long sleeves, even thin ones, because then I just think of them clinging to my sticky, sweaty skin. What I‚Äôm trying to say is, actually living in the South is suffering.	labels:I apologise to the people who live in oppressively hot climates, because fashion isn‚Äôt a priority then. I however included some impractical fashions because I couldn‚Äôt help it. But when it‚Äôs sweltering, i‚Äôll have my hair scraped in a no-nonsense bun, no makeup and a boxy airy top and elastic waist shorts.
text:The South isn't "oppressively hot," so you don't need to apologize for anything! Most of this album is perfectly wearable. I live in a part of the world that is hotter year round than the American southeast, with no real winter and high humidity. People here wear pants and sleeves and long dresses, not just tank tops and shorts, because (a) who wants to limit their wardrobe to tank tops and shorts all year? and (b) sun damage is a very real thing! Some people have different tolerances for sweat or sun, but living in hot weather isn't really equivalent to living in extremely cold climates.  Not to mention, it's not suffocatingly hot at *night*. A lot of these looks which may be too warm for day (leather and velvet dresses) may be tolerable at night. Or just fine in buildings with air conditioning!  You did a good job with the album! The loose sleeves and lacy fabrics are actually pretty practical when it's warm. I wear long sleeve stuff but loose stuff because half the battle is preventing the sun from cooking you alive.	labels:That‚Äôs incredibly kind of you, I appreciate the encouragement. I guess people deal with heat their own ways! If i‚Äôm in the sun, I will wear covered clothes in natural fabrics and in relaxed fit. I hate a hot forearm exposed to the sun that goes red! Some days I don‚Äôt care to slather on sunscreen so i‚Äôll throw a big loose denim jacket on. I‚Äôve gotten used to it though (most everyone in my burb doesn‚Äôt like to cover up in summer and I stand out! They all have skin that tans and apparently doesn‚Äôt get burnt. Lucky Australians)
text:I'm with you. It's a different kind of hot you get when you're covered up in hot weather vs when your skin is exposed to sunlight in hot weather. Personally, I can deal with the "overheating-hot" feeling from being covered up way more than the "burning-hot" sensation from exposed skin.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Shitpost Saturday: Ghost Outfit	labels:Humiliation in life. Humiliation in death.  I've died wearing the too-large, white-but-actually-gray-at-this-point, ratty bathrobe given to me by my ex over a decade ago. I haven't had a haircut in almost 2 years and I'm not even wearing socks.   The worst part is that I spilled coffee on myself, so now I have a coffee stain on my chest for all of eternity.  I think it's safe to assume that I died from falling down the stairs or some shit after spilling coffee all over myself. I'm going to haunt the path outside my house because when the wind blows really hard, it actually howls down the path and it's spooky AF. I think I need all the help I can get, give the whole bathrobe situation. Though my coffee stain MIGHT pass for blood, so that's cool.  People aren't creative at all, so I'm probably going to get called something stupid like Bathrobe Witch. Or like, The Ghost of... Well I'm not actually going to put the name of the path because I don't want someone to find out where I live and make me actually dead.

text:General Discussion - January 03, 2021	labels:Done a lot of thinking about my wardrobe and the amount of clothes I own and I think I‚Äôm gonna go through and pick a bunch of clothes to donate tonight.   I think it‚Äôs time I let the thrifting and g r a p h i c t e e life go for a bit. I own way too many band shirts and shit that I just don‚Äôt wear anymore. I need to suck it up and start investing in my wardrobe to get it to a place I want it to be instead of buying a ton of shitty bandaids for 8 bucks a pop at thrift stores. Time to be a big boy and learn to go for a few expensive pieces instead of a ton of cheap ones.   Wish me luck lads.
text:I started doing around the beginning of the pandemic. There are several vintage/thrift shops near me, and for like two years they were my go-to for outerwear and the occasional shirts and pants. But it's so easy to start picking things up just because they're cheaper, and not be happy with them just a couple months down the line...  I've got maybe three or four real gems that I still wear from vintage hunting, but everything else has been donated or sold. I'm much happier with my wardrobe now, especially since I started to invest in nicer stuff. I'm wishing you all the best through that transition!	labels:I have gotten a ton of cool shit from thrifting but it really is so easy to grab something for grabbing something‚Äôs sake. Especially going to the cheaper places in NYC like L train. Soon you‚Äôre taking back like 2 or 3 pieces a visit, that shit adds up quick.    Thank you!!!
text:Definitely. For me, I went to some of the shops enough that I'd chat with the owners when I stopped in. For sure I value the idea of supporting local businesses + building relationships with people who are hustling hard, but it also made it much harder to leave without picking something up haha	labels:Oh that‚Äôs what I do 100%.

text:what do yall wear to the gym (or at home if you work out there)	labels:I'd like to go deeper and talk about fabrics and the clothing in the gym. There are fabrics that leave you soaking in sweat after your routine while some that just makes you feel uncomfortable while running in trails. For my experience I can suggest to use cotton, nylon or polyester.    In terms of avoiding whiff in workout apparels, cotton wins over polyester. This is because studies discovered that it provides less post-workout stench compared to polyester since synthetic fabrics allow the multiplication of stink-causing bacteria.    Polyester is one of the most famous types of workout fabrics that‚Äôs primarily plastic cloth. It is efficient as a fitness apparel because it‚Äôs durable, lightweight, breathable, wrinkle-resistant and non-absorbent.    Nylon is found in various kinds of sportswear for being breathable and sweat-wicking. In fact, a lot of its users say that it can stand up to even the sweatiest of workouts.    Recently I ordered a cotton T-shirt from True Classic. I can say that it's very comfortable, the fabric is good quality and non-absorbent.	episode_done:True

I'm considering putting one onto the back of a denim jacket, but don't want to ruin the needlework. I'm very torn about it. I think if I take proper care laundering, it'll be ok.

Growing up I learned to wash everything together on cold. As an adult I had to read articles and watch YouTube videos on how to care for my clothing. I recommend everyone learn how to properly launder their clothing.
text:I agree, I've never understood what people are doing in the laundry to make their clothes literally fall apart after a few washes. Washing on the hottest setting and drying high heat, maybe?  Ive legitimately never had anything fall apart in the wash ever and I dont take particular care other than cold water and low heat in the dryer (plus not chucking things like sweaters, dress shirts and leggings in the dryer at all). And I used the communal machines in my apartment!	labels:The washing machine at my apartment is very rough on clothing. It's a top loader with an agitator and the machines are 'twin thin' (very small). My clothing goes through the ringer in that machine. I don't know how, but my clothing gets knotted up into a huge wet ball. Sometimes the clothing ball is stuck to the agitator and you just have to blindly yank around until it comes loose. But after I realized the machine sucks... I didn't put anything nice/delicate in it ever again.  So yeah.. If your washing machine sucks, hate to break it to you, but you need to hand wash anything you aren't willing to sacrifice to the laundry gods.

This bag gets the most use (and abuse), and when it wears out, I replace it.  I have one casual bag that I bought easily a decade ago. It's the ThinkGeek Handbag of Holding, and it has so many pockets. It was my daily bag at a different phase of my life. It isn't dressy enough for the office, but I'll use it on camping/beach trips when I don't want to throw my work purse into the sand.  I also have 4-5 smaller purses that I've received as gifts over the years. I don't use those very often, as I prefer larger bags, but I save them for job interviews, weddings, and other special occasions. And since they don't get much use, they tend to stay in great condition.	episode_done:True

text:I actually would disagree that it makes them look dated. That baggy look where it goes over the shoes a bit is a huge trend right now. Though, I do see that fit mostly for denim, but I don't think it makes these pants look bad or dated. The 90's/00's are really starting to come back.	labels:Maybe it looks better with jeans, but I think the style makes it look a bit dated. Maybe it‚Äôs also bc there is no world where I‚Äôm ready for the ‚Äúpant resting on the shoe‚Äù trend to come back.

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - November 10, 2020	labels:**Jamieson Shetland Sweaters**   I'm successively (re-) building my wardrobe around the themes of responsibility and (scandinavian) minimalism. That for me is: Few high quality items that are made ethically and sustainably and work well together to achieve the aforementioned aesthetic. Currently I'm in the market for a somewhat textured but simple grey wool crew-neck-sweater for fall and warmer winter days, preferably made in Europe. I have been looking at Harleys, Howlin, Sunspel and Jamieson's and have a tendency for the latter because of them as far as I know being actually made completely on the Shetland Isles. Now for my two questions:   1. Jamiesons's is the most affordable of these brands (which is not a priority for me but also does not hurt ofc). Do any of you have experience with their quality, longevity, fit etc.? How do they compare to the other brands?   2. Would you go for a light grey (their "Granite") or a medium-dark grey (their "slate") for maximum versatility in the context of scandinavian minimalism?

text:Permanent Style - The Cold-Colour Capsule	labels:The way he handles the idea of cool/warm colors is strange. Like, he writes blue is a warm color. What? There aren't really, in itself, cool and warm colors, like, you can't say green as a whole is warm or cool. It's about undertones. You can easily find warm green and cool green, so is blue, so is every color.
text:Welllll... he answered me on instagram, and it seems like he *was* talking about "cool" in this sense, but he didn't really explain that, and also meant to imply unsaturated / whatever, and that part was more important...

text:How Japan's Best Men‚Äôs Magazines Gained a Cult Following in the US	labels:I wonder if /u/Shrimp_My_Ride might be able to provide his perspective on the differences that the Japanese mindset/values have that result in such detailed products
text:Absolutely and thanks for the heads up. In my mind, it is two basic factors...devotion to principle and attention to detail.      The first is that when Japanese people choose a job or a hobby or something similar, they really make it the central focus on their lives. They tend to work way harder, spend way more time talking and thinking about it, and work much longer hours. If you have a magazine, not only the founder and main editors, but every little guy down to the smallest job will really devote themselves to that job, prioritizing it over their free time and identifying the purpose of their lives as to make that magazine the best it can be. Japanese people don't sit at work thinking about what they will do when they get off, they sit at home thinking about what they will do when they get to work.    Second, Japanese people tend to be VERY detail-oriented (read, anal-retentive). And they will have meeting after meeting or spend hour after hour on the tiniest detail. And maybe it's not anything that anybody would ever notice, but together it really forms the bigger picture. Just as an example, I am a shoe guy and a few weeks ago I tied my laces in something called the "berluti knot" to try something new. 10+ people the very first day at my company must have noticed it and asked questions about what it was, why I was using it, how to tie it, etc.    I could write more, believe me. And obviously these are generalizations and there are lazy, directionless Japanese people and those from other countries with these qualities as well. But speaking as an overall trend, this is why we see the uniqueness and quality of certain Japanese things.	labels:Love the shoe knot anecdote. That is attention to detail and bet made your day providing "tutorials" on how to tie that knot :)

She has her own very distinct style, but clearly enjoys learning about new and different things. She tries out alot of fashion-related things but is really informative about them, and not doing it just because she can. Videos of other Youtubers that I've tried to watch, seem to focus alot more on the "haul" and materialism aspect which isn't necessarily bad, but bores me. Some of them actually have interesting items or outfits, but they don't go beyond "hey, doesn't this look cool" or "hey I got this thing everyone else wants".

text:Shitpost Saturday: Grandma's Gift	labels:So it was actually my mom this time around. I'm old enough to be a g'ma myself so I figure Mom gets a pass.  I was chatting with some friends a few days ago about that stupid "We try to explain the 1979 Sears Wish Book to a millenial" article and for some reason I uttered (well, typed) the words "I miss velour". Well, I opened the Big Box O Stuff From Mom, and what should be in there but.... a velour zip-up cardigan. In a hideous print. With a zipper pull that's meant to look like metal but is obviously plastic (wouldn't have been surprised if it had come off in my hand). Did I mention the hideous print is BLUE? I don't even like blue.  But on the other hand.... it's SO WARM. And unlike most of the gifts of my childhood, it FITS PERFECTLY. It's not too big, not too tight, and somehow not a million miles too long.  Velour, though. I don't even know where the hell she finds these things.  I'll wear it over the festive Minnie and Mickey sweatshirt she got me last year. God knows what I'll wear under that as the sweatshirt is basically transparent. Hopefully I won't have to get up during the call because all that fits my lower half right now is sweatpants.	episode_done:True

text:Anyone have a job that requires you to wear "work clothes" (nursing, trades, etc.)? What is your off-duty wardrobe like?	labels:I work in a food safety lab, so we have to wear lab coats, uniforms, and even specific shoes. My off-duty wardrobe is, like everyone else's in our position, larger than it needs to be.  But since I live in a colder climate, I've gotten really into outerwear like coats & scarfs since that's the one thing I can control every single day on my way to and from work!  When I first started in my lab, I didnt want to put on a whole new outfit when I got home because I'm lazy and hate doing laundry.  But after a while, I got to the point where I just wanted to feel cute and like myself! These days I basically change outfits entirely in the evening when I get home just to have a little style in my day.  I also started wearing my "special occasion" clothes more regularly too since when else are we gonna wear them?!  Last night I wanted to look cute but didnt want to put any effort into it, so I put on a chiffon tank top and cozy sweater with nice leggings.  And you know what - I felt fancy as fuck sitting on my couch eating burritos with my husband.  I've decided that it's just about finding that balance between needing to feel put together at some point during your day/life, and how much effort you want to put in.	episode_done:True

text:How would you describe the quality of self-knit/self-made clothes vs. store bought?	labels:It would depend on the skill and machinery of the sewist - I have definitely made clothes that I like and will likely keep wearing, but they‚Äôre not the most structurally beautiful garments and are not the same quality craftsmanship you‚Äôd get from a higher end brand. Part of it is equipment - I don‚Äôt have a serger which is used a lot in clothing making - and part of it is I‚Äôm not that concerned about the seams on the inside of a garment that only I will ever wear. That being said, if I had taken the time to do proper seams, there is no reason those garments wouldn‚Äôt last just as long as higher end garments.
text:Not to mention the quality of the fabric used. I sew and consider myself an average sewist. If I take the time and have a good pattern and quality fabric I feel my clothes are pretty decent. Probably not equal to very high end, but because I can adjust fit very early in the process they can look better than fast fashion with fit issues.  That being said not everything I make turns out like I hoped it would. But I have several items of clothing that I have been wearing for years and I will wear until they wear out because they fit, are completely my style, and I love them.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Discussion: Clay Jewelry?	labels:I love / hate them.  They can be so beautiful, but so so so fragile.  I just recently purchased two pairs of clay earrings from a local ceramic artist at our farmers market, however, I‚Äôve already dropped and shattered one of them already.  Every clay set of jewelry (earrings and pendant necklace) I‚Äôve ever owned has eventually broken - baring this last set of yellow earrings I‚Äôm now handling with extreme care.  They are beautiful and I‚Äôll probably buy more because I love this girl‚Äôs work, but I just have to know going into it that this is not something I‚Äôll most likely be able to keep forever and pass on, so I keep that in mind regarding price when purchasing them.	episode_done:True
text:How do I figure out my "style"?	labels:I think start by looking at pictures online on Pinterest or Instagram of styles you find aesthetically pleasing and create a little dashboard with outfits that catch your eye. You can also think about some of your favourite actors or singers that wear outfits you like and try to save the pictures you find. After that i would go window-shopping online on websites that fit your budget and look around trying to find pieces similar to any outfits you saw. fyi; i would browse on a website first and then go to the actual store to try out what you saw online, it gives you an idea of what you‚Äôre looking for.  I think imitation is the easiest way to start finding your style. Once your comfortable in a type of style you can start experimenting with it and picking more personalized pieces. Good luck :)
text:I've tried that but feel like the outfits are too much for a casual stop at the grocery store. Any tips on that?	labels:My style aspiration has always been something analogous to let's say upper east side. Completely not practical for my budget or lifestyle. For awhile I avoided it, but honestly I didn't really feel like I came into my own style wise until I figured out how to adapt things to my own life.   What I liked was a put together look, polished accessories, and femme style.   For me that means combining dressy with casual. The skirt goes with sneakers. Instead of a blouse, I might wear a tee shirt. Instead of heels - fancy flats. And overall I found my own interpretation of things.	episode_done:True

text:Hair accessories - professional or should be saved for casual environments?	labels:I think they can work as long as you consider how they fit with your outfit and the colour palette.  A coworker wore a lovely green scarf tied loosely around her ponytail once and the rest of her outfit was grey/black and simple. It looked great. Had she worn a bright blue dress and bright red lipstick with it, maybe not, at least in a professional environment.  Some women get away with dressing a bit eccentric, but I‚Äôd say they‚Äôre almost always in a senior role, near retiring or very young. I say ‚Äòget away with‚Äô because we technically have no dress code, aside from something really inappropriate.  Intend to stick to neutrals and darker colours. I have a few plain tops in bright colours, but I always pair them with very simple and plain items. It‚Äôs not that dislike them, but they require more thought!	episode_done:True

text:Inspiration has to come from somewhere: Skulls and Bones	labels:can you fit a sandwich in these?	episode_done:True
text:What do you think are the pieces of jewelry everyone should own?	labels:This is one of those things you need to pick according to what you like. Classic jewellery can look outdated.  For example, I have no interest in diamonds so have no interest in owning any (Or any imitation ones), although I would say the diamond studs are the closest to timeless you'll get. I do like pearls, but until quite recently they were not "fashionable" and read as either dated or a statement piece, depending on how you styled them and who you were. Also, pearls come in different shapes and I think the baroque pearls were less "old lady" than round ones. But Im.not sure if they were ever mainstream popular or just Etsy-boho crowd popular? So, no not necessarily timeless looking. Another thing with real pearls is they are not stones and they are perishable. They will deteriorate if you don't care for/store them correctly. If you can't be bothered with that then get glass, Swarovski make nice ones.  Turquoise and coral read as very 2000s to me (It's lovely but it just seems that way to me!) and amber very "middle aged art teacher". So again, a stone might not seem timeless. Size and shape and length of beaded necklaces go in and out of style too.  As for types, I don't like bracelets/watches much , and rings don't suit my lifestyle anymore so I don't wear any of my collection now.   Basicly, buy things you like that go with what you wear and suit your lifestyle. If you want to invest in beautiful pieces you love then do it, but don't expect any of it to be "timeless"/always look contemporary.	episode_done:True
text:What‚Äôs something you wish you could tell clothing manufacturers to do differently?	labels:More jackets with inside pockets.  More raglan sleeves and fewer drop-shoulder sleeves. I prefer a regular shoulder seam, but I think a raglan sleeve looks better than drop sleeves while also making for a more forgiving fit than a regular seam.  This isn't really a manufacturing issue but I wish they'd just size men's and women's shoes the same in the US--an 8 should be a certain number of in/cm rather than changing with the shoe's "gender."  I saw a couple comments about more elastic in clothing and I think this is actually way more common than it was 10-15 years ago because of the effect of the athleisure trend (and it's probably cheaper). It used to be that elastic waists were common in clothing marketed toward older women, plus size women, and young children, but they weren't standard and it was supposed to be embarrassing if you wore elastic-waist pants.
text:I agree with you about everything except the sleeves, I personally would like to throw all raglan sleeves into a fire, and love a dropped sleeve. It‚Äôs all preference of course, I swam and rowed for years and have massive shoulders and am very self conscious about how raglans emphasize my shoulders.   Ditto on the elastic! I bought some fancy selvage (ie no stretch whatsoever) jeans and I a) can barely sit in them and b) cannot for the life of me fathom how I wore jeans prior to them containing spandex/elastin or some variety of stretch- I did, but I don‚Äôt know how.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What‚Äôs some of the best general advice you‚Äôd give to someone new to female fashion?	labels:Don‚Äôt jump on trends...everything falls in and out of fashion if you wait long enough. Find a store/brand that you like the fit and cut of clothes on you and try to build a capsule wardrobe. Once you see what you like, you achieve a timeless look that doesn‚Äôt look trendy or dated. From there, feel free to incorporate fun pieces that can be easily added to other outfits like accessories or shoes.	episode_done:True
text:Handbag conundrum: lesser know (and lesser seen all over the place) or standard luxury designer bags (think the usual Gucci, YSL, LV, etc.)	labels:Definitely buy what makes you happy. The fact that you have looked at the high end, well known brands and came away disappointed indicates that (this season at least), they aren't for you.   To answer your question directly: for me, personally, showing my own style is 1000% more important than showing the status of a luxury brand. Do the two sometimes overlap? Yes, and that's fine. But I don't personally get buying something *just* because it is a certain brand. Who are you trying to impress? What are you conveying with that logo (wow, you're well off? What kind of message is that, on its own?) I just feel like people who are super into labels, not the design or the style or anything else, just come across as kind of immature? The truth is, anyone worth spending much time with isn't overly concerned with what logo your bag has. (Now! I will concede there is a difference between showing off luxury brands and having higher end items, in some circles. Like, there could be some tension if you're hanging out with super millionaire socialites and everything you wear is from TJ Maxx...but in that case, I'd still say its important to focus on personal style first. And knowing about smaller higher end designers, rather than designers you can buy at a mall, is a whole different thing too...)
text:I feel like showing off the logo is more of a poor person trying to look rich thing. Truly wealthy people don't try to show off like that. Also, a lot of the purses with very prominent logos are fugly.	labels:Truly wealthy people wear whatever they want because they don't have anything to prove or disprove. The Kardashians are very rich yet they have no problem wearing leggings and a t-shirt or being all decked out in Balmain, Gucci, LV.
text:Yeah, I know people with millions of dollars and they definitely have branded clothes/accessories. The main things are they aren't buying them *because* of the brand logo alone and they don't show off the logo. Like, if they're carrying a Chanel bag or whatever, they are just carrying it like a purse, they aren't shifting it so the logo is always visible and holding their arms funny so anyone passing can tell what it is (which is legit something I've seen people do)...but yeah, the idea that every really wealthy person is just minimalist and discreet is pretty laughable.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What do you get tailored?	labels:I get almost everything other than lounge clothes tailored. Size number means absolutely nothing anymore. Buy clothes that fit the widest part of your body, and have them taken in to fit the rest (it‚Äôs harder to let out than take in). Some of my dresses are 6s, and some are 0s, so size is literally just a made up concept for women. This definitely gets expensive, but I add the cost of tailoring to the cost of the thing I know I‚Äôll need tailored.   So like, if I see a skirt I really want, but I‚Äôll need the waist taken in, I know that my tailor streamlines waistbands with a zipper for 30 bucks. 35 if there‚Äôs a lining. That turns a $50 skirt into an $80 skirt. Do I really want to spend $80 on a skirt?? Maybe. If I do, I‚Äôll buy it. If not, I put it back. It ends up saving me money because I buy less impulse trendy purchases.   Find a good tailor by testing them on cheap pieces and building a reputation. Eventually, you‚Äôll know exactly how much they charge for each fabric/type of alteration and it helps with keeping prices in mind while shopping. A good tailor will have no problem at all with silks or satins. You may have to burn through a few and have them ruin some clothes before you find your soulmate, but it‚Äôs totally worth it! I recently broke up with my tailor and I‚Äôm still heartbroken about it..

Honestly in college/post college I almost never shopped because I was so broke, which lead me to going a bit crazy once I did have disposable income.   I kind of think of clothes shopping in terms of ‚Äúneeds‚Äù and ‚Äúwants,‚Äù but it sounds like new clothes aren‚Äôt really either for you right now.

text:What pieces would you love "backups" of?	labels:This is pretty uninspired, but I have a lot of basics that I wish I had bought in duplicates, but didn't buy in duplicates, because I figured they were basics and I could always just get more.   Alas. The styles changed just a bit, and now I can't find the plain white tanks and tees I want because the sleeves and the neckline and the length are all just a tiny bit off. Thank you for reading along, this not-a-real-problem is very frustrating at times.

text:Thoughts on Shein?	labels:Don‚Äôt buy from there if you want clothes that last any longer than 4 months. It‚Äôs terrible for the environment and they have child labor as the reason they‚Äôre so cheap.  That being said, I know it‚Äôs a puller because a lot of people cannot afford the cost of clothes that are visually high fashion and shien is appealing for it‚Äôs low price. If you can afford to buy better and more expensive clothing, do so. It‚Äôs worth the price in the long run, and you won‚Äôt be helping this scummy company.  If you cannot afford higher, then I understand buying from shien, but recognize that they are a terrible company and see if you can find any good thrift stores or online resellers that may be around the same price range for a much more ethical choice.

text:Fall 2020 Fit Battle - Elite 8 - Discussion	labels:Only 8 people so I can stand to do a write up this time.   *HalfTheGold vs. Plasma*  Both pretty solid fits. Plasma edged this one out for me just because Chuck's seemed a bit too similar to last week. I do wish Plasma's trousers leaned a bit more to one extreme of fit, to me they seem in kind of a no man's land of straight.  *Raiora vs. Sal*  Tough one to pick for me. Raiora always brings a crazy mix of pieces together and they always work so well. However, this time I think the trousers were a bit too flat looking in texture compared to the guage of the cardigan. Sals fit was unexpected but good, the overlapping layers and texture mixing was really cool imo.  *Joel vs. Ngo*  I went back and forth on this one for awhile, definitely most difficult match-up for me. Both had some very similar ideas with silhouette, both executed very well. My personal preference is towards Ngo as I really liked the subtle textures displayed in his detail shot, but in the end I copped out and voted for both.  *Chunsak vs. Comeback*  Always love seeing what these guys bring to the table. Both their fits are great, but Chunsak going maximal English countryside estate owner won me over in the end.	episode_done:True
text:Do you: 1) keep all of your wardrobe equally diverse, or 2) keep all of your wardrobe minimal, or 3) keep some pieces relatively similar while diversifying others?	labels:I keep most of my wardrobe relatively similar.  My work outfit is one of five pairs of pants, a button down, or a tee with a blazer.  My weekend uniform is athletic wear or jeans with a tank or tee in one of like five colors.  Mostly everything is black, gray, white, light blue, navy, with some camel and tomato red.  Only dresses really deviate here.    I play with shoes, makeup, and sunglasses to mix up my basic wardrobe.  And my bikini collection is relatively extensive, I have more bikinis than pairs of pants.	episode_done:True

Its always been my fave season for dressing.
text:While sunflowers are thought to have originated in Mexico and Peru, they are one of the first plants to ever be cultivated in the United States. They have been used for more than 5,000 years by the Native Americans, who not only used the seeds as a food and an oil source, but also used the flowers, roots and stems for varied purposes including as a dye pigment. The Spanish explorers brought sunflowers back to Europe, and after being first grown in Spain, they were subsequently introduced to other neighboring countries. Currently, sunflower oil is one of the most popular oils in the world. Today, the leading commercial producers of sunflower seeds include the Russian Federation, Peru, Argentina, Spain, France and China.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Permanent Style - The Cold-Colour Capsule	labels:See, I'm confused. In what sense are blues not the coolest colors? Why does this guide almost entirely exclude navy? In what sense are brown, black, grey and cream cold?
text:he's probably focusing less on navy bc he views it in a more formal context. Navy is mentioned as being a decent colour to add as a adjunct rather than a main focus. Certain shades of brown are colder than others because they have more cool tones like greys compared to a red-cast warmer brown.  I just posted this as an interesting illustration of how someone can think about colour, it's not meant to be a definitive authoritative post	labels:But grey isn't a cool tone. Grey is a neutral tone.  I understand if the premise excludes navy, but if it does, shouldn't th title be a "Neutral-Colour Capsule" or something like that?
text:He does link to another post where he details the logic behind his warm/cold colour theory if that helps you to make sense of it. I think it's just a matter of semantics that seems to be your issue with it? As long as the main point gets across I think it's fine for people to have different wordings	labels:I tried reading that and didn't understand his point at all.  It's a matter of semantics about the title and core theme of the article. If you can't explain what he means by "cold" then I don't know what the article is about. If he means "neutral" the article is *much more confusing*.	episode_done:True

text:Model poses while online shopping	labels:They do that when the fit if the garment is inferior. It is intentional.

Well constructed items are not shot in this manner. Brands want to show off their excellent construction. It is known.  Hope that helps!

I was firmly in camp ‚Äúleggings are pants‚Äù back in the day, but I‚Äôll be happy to go back to only wearing them on the weekends.   I know I could go ahead and wear denim if I wanted, but it feels pointless changing into jeans just to drive to the post office or grocery pickup.

But I do miss my less-comfy casual outfits.	episode_done:True
text:What are your predictions for 2021 suit style?	labels:Working within a multi brand store, a lot of what the buying team is seeing is relaxed fits, patch pockets and a pretty standard over arching lapel size (let‚Äôs say 2in), but it still keeping towards formal regimented shoulders (with very subtle roping) and small amounts of taper to the trouser and waist. Almost half of the suits  reviewed having pleats, but less function and more to bring an elongated look when sans jackets. Lots of hopsack open weaves giving a more draped look. I‚Äôm saying all this at least in our market, when people are looking for suits it‚Äôs become clear people want far less patterns, and moving towards subtle pinheads and puppy‚Äôs tooth, or even tone on tone 5mm window pane. In darker colours even coming into summer. COVID has pushed suits in our market back towards the cleaner look, with textured shirts and a little more fun with ties. Saying all this though it‚Äôs super dependent on where you are in the world and where you associate yourself in the corresponding circles.  So tldr: shrug*

text:Hair accessories - professional or should be saved for casual environments?	labels:I think hair accessories in the workplace are fine as long as they're deployed thoughtfully. Nice scrunchies and those slightly high profile headbands can work pretty well when combined with a polished outfit and subtle jewelry (or more creative outfits and jewelry if your office is more casual). I work for a nonprofit that straddles a few different different fields (economic and business dev, higher ed, entrepreneurship, etc) so I interact with a wide range of dress codes and dress code interpretations.   I'd love to wear more headbands but I'm a whiner with a huge head and they pinch too badly to get through a work day; I love the look of the almost turban-styled headbands though and don't think they're automatically off limits for a biz caz office. But then I've worn a black scarf scrunchie to work on a sleek ponytail with a sleek turtleneck and skirt outfit, and I semi-regularly deploy interesting clips (geometric, tortoiseshell, or single jewel bobby pins).	episode_done:True
text:Technical/Labwear but make it fashion	labels:I need to wear a uniform in my lab job and keep my hair tied back, but I love using cute hair accessories in my ponytails and different hair clips and scrunchies.

text:A Basic Guide to Useful Knitwear	labels:I‚Äôm going to disagree that no seams is a rule of thumb for better construction‚Äîsometimes those seams help give you more structure and a better tailored look. It depends on the type of sweater you‚Äôre aiming for, of course, but something like a shawl collared cardigan in a heavy knit would benefit from a size seam to help keep it from ending up around your knees by the end of the day.   If you‚Äôre a trans man like myself, the side seam will help give you a line for the eye to follow along the sides of your body, too.   I only add these as considerations because I knit and design my own garments and while the rule of thumb isn‚Äôt necessarily entirely wrong, it‚Äôs really more nuanced than ‚Äúavoid side seams because it‚Äôs better constructed‚Äù	episode_done:True

They're very helpful, but garment measurements are taken from the outside of the garment, so the thickness of the garment factors in, structure factors in, your layers factor in... there are a lot of variables, so again, be aware of the return policy.	episode_done:True

Basically, I can't decide if it's cool to wear a hoodie with my name printed on it, or if it's narcissistic/just kinda cringey. I think I would definitely wear the brand if that wasn't my name, but I also feel like because it is, that might be the only thing people notice when they see me wear it. Thoughts?

text:A discussion about ‚Äúknockoff culture‚Äù	labels:Logos are *trademarked. Clothing designs are... a more grey area. Like, a v neck knit sweater can only be designed so many ways, you know? However there are some instances where parts of a design are copyrighted, like i think the red soles on Loubitons, which i cannot spell, are copyrighted/trademark. Prints and artwork are a whole other story.  There are a lot of factors and copyright and intellectual property law also differs from country to country - there is no international copyright law, just general agreements between specific countries.  I personally feel that knockoffs and replicas are different. Replicas are illegal as they are faking an item AND copying the logo. Knockoffs that just copy the design... not illegal, generally speaking. Ethical? Truly depends on the situation.  In your specific examples, yeah theyre probably inspired by Sezane but tbh theyre not really dupes, there are clear design differences in each example.
text:I've watched a video on this and I think you're right.  Also, I think the argument is that a knock-off is not going to steal market share from the original. Those who want to and can afford a high end designer brand aren't going to buy a knock-off and those who do probably can't afford the original.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Using Pinterest to Help Find Your Style (or: how to tell Pinterest it is no longer 2012)	labels:Thank you for the in depth breakdown! I actually use Pintrest for most of my fashion finding needs and I've been in the habit of reworking my algorithm often. As soon as I start getting recommended a bunch of things I don't like I start unfollowing boards and abusing the hide button like crazy. I also went through and organized all my boards with the new subcategory option to combine a lot of my boards together.   Another note that might help people is if you can't figure out why your still getting recommended out of date pins, go back into your boards that your feed recommends from and delete the older pins that you no longer like. I went back into all my fashion boards and went to the pins I'd pinned when I first got into Pintrest (in like 2012) that were definitely no longer my style. Once those were no longer there to draw from my feed changed pretty dramatically.	episode_done:True

text:How do you dress in a casual work environment if you really enjoy fashion/dressing up?	labels:I have worked in casual places for the last few jobs now, and my motto is dress up but add one casual thing to dress it down or only have one dressy element per outfit.  That might mean wearing some sneakers with your fave dress. Wear your fancy skirt with a t-shirt or sweatshirt instead of a blouse. If you want to wear a blazer - make it a fun color, fun pattern, or softer less structured fabric. You wear your fancy trousers with a graphic tee and a jean jacket/leather jacket/chore jacket. You wear some vintage wash mom jeans with a t-shirt/boxy sweater and heels (or fancy boots).  This gives you one foot in casual, but gives you space to wear your favorites. And you do not feel ridiculously overdresses when your peers are wearing leggings and flannel shirts.  You also learn to go with it, and everyone thinks you are a dress up person.  These are my tips as a dressy person who works in casual Bay Area tech land.  And I'll chime in on the no crop tops if skin is visible! Not appropriate (although I know dress codes are loosening and people are doing it.... but it is a bad idea!).	episode_done:True

text:FAQ: How do I pick out my first suit for professional internships, interviews, etc.?	labels:Color: navy or charcoal. Maybe some subtle pinstripes but nothing flashy. 2 button, single breasted. Don't wear a  vest. If it's cold, wear an overcoat, inside should be warm enough for just a suit coat. Suit coat should come down to about your knuckles. I usually opt for a white shirt and a tie with a conservative pattern.  Honestly, I got my interview suit at Macy's for just under $300. Needed a little work in the sleeves but otherwise wasn't terrible. It's your first job, people don't expect you to have a bespoke suit, but you shouldn't look like you picked it up at Goodwill either. You can usually find something at Men's Wearhouse or any of the major department stores, and then get the pants and sleeves hemmed to the appropriate length. The stores should all have modern slim fits, but don't get something that scrunches up if you button the top button.
text:Yep. Men‚Äôs warehouse or department store is fine for first suit. Just make sure to get it tailored. A lot of people will try to bash, but a properly tailored suit from either of those places will work great.   Also I‚Äôm big on charcoal for first suit. Every man should have a charcoal suit.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What do YOU do with "chub rub" jeans?	labels:I did a patch with a pair of jeans I noticed wearing down a lot. Took some spare fabric (two pieces a bit larger than the palm of my hand, larger than the area that was wearing out) and sewed it on the inside around the area wearing out. Then set the sewing machine to a zigzag stitch with blue thread (a bit too light, but that‚Äôs what I had on hand) and just went to town going back and forth over the entire area. It‚Äôs worked well for more wears than any other patch methods I‚Äôve tried	episode_done:True

Almost every woman I know is bloody sick and tired of not getting to dress up, not being able to wear lipstick, not having places to wear heels and vacation outfits. People would literally go crazy and it truly would be the roaring twenties.

text:How do I feel sexy at home in winter?	labels:matching bra and panties. it works wonders. I do this in the summer too (on summer bra days, which with boob sweat there are not many). when I buy a new bra, I typically get 2-3 coordinating panties in different styles so I have some options, and then put them together under all my clothes. I swear there's a posture change when I'm wearing ratty underclothes vs nice ones. even if no one sees it, I know it's there.
text:Second this. Pretty sleep clothes also. I've been wearing ripped leggings, non matching underwear, an old shirt, and not shaving for months now and I feel terrible lol. I got a silky cami set earlier in the year and a chiffon one with long pants and felt so nice. Could get a little chilly, but a nice blanket helped.

text:A Bespoke Shirtmaker On How A Shirt Should Fit	labels:Sleeves are my eternal issue with shirts, and why for so long I opted for short sleeve shirts. So often with RTW shirts the cuffs are so big they start sliding down my hand (looking at you, Charles Tyrwhitt). If they have a second button quite often it makes a dip in a bit rather than the complete circle and often still goes down my hand enough that the cuff bends when I move my hands. So many RTW shirts also have their sleeves a bit too short for me (kind of acceptable considering overly large cuffs). Some end up being too tight in the upper sleeve, painfully cutting into my arms if I reach forward (looking at you again, Charles Tyrwhitt) no matter the size. I don't remember shirts doing this in the past so perhaps an issue since I gained weight.	episode_done:True

text:Drake's Collection One, 2021 Lookbook	labels:Love Drake's style, but it's so expensive. Any more affordable alternatives (preferably european)?
text:Yes! It takes a bit of work but you can definitely replicate Drake‚Äôs styling for much cheaper.   A lot of the value of Drake‚Äôs is in their styling, and a lot of what they sell is basics. Some of their clothes are literally just marked up pieces manufactured by other brands - their suede crepe sole shoes are Astorflex, for example. A lot of it is also basics, and you can find a lot of similar stuff at other brands for much cheaper. For example, kamakura has great slim fit oxford cloth shirts with a substantial collar for a fraction of the price of Drake‚Äôs. You can find slim fit high rise jeans for much less than they charge at lots of brands nowadays.   It takes a bit of sleuthing but I‚Äôve been able to replicate the ‚Äúdrake‚Äôs look‚Äù much more cheaply. For example, I really liked their crepe soled suede shoes, so I bought a pair of astorflex chukkas for $40 on eBay. I liked their corduroy chore coat so I bought a j crew one for $100. I have brushed shetlands from other brands - also made in Scotland, but a lot cheaper. The main thing that‚Äôs tough to replicate is their ties and scarves, IMO. Even that, you might have luck with some clever searches on eBay.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Tips for reducing impulse buying/careless spending?	labels:Organize & clean everything I already own before I buy.   For example, if I want to buy another pair of jeans & a top, I do my laundry and put it all away and have my closet looking uncluttered. Often I just want the feeling of something clean & new. It also helps me purchase items I might actually wear more often because as I put items away I think about how much I enjoy/wear them and why	episode_done:True
text:Winter jackets that are good for skiing and casual use?	labels:Dont go crazy on a jacket.  The key for skiing is layers and you can get a lot of layers that work well in other settings.   A decent base layer:  you can go merino or if you are on a budget milsurp poly pro.  A fleece over that.  Next layer is a beefier jacket.  Right now I have a half zip Patagonia that is poly insulated.  Then get a waterproof(ish) layer.  You have a lot of options but I usually run with a marmot precip.  It's cheap, has pit zips and folds up way smaller than a hard shell. That combo will cover you skiing 90%of the time and let you adjust depending o N conditions. Flexibility is the key.  Take the money you save and get some good socks and gloves/mittens and some type of balaclava.  No one ever came off of the mountain because their chest was cold but it was their hands/feet/face.
text:This is the right advice. I've been a ski racer for many years. Most of the best jackets like Arc'teryx, HH, etc will prioritize their shells with all the nice features like Recco, pit zips, pass pockets, goggle cleaners etc. Shells are excellent for cutting through wind and then you can have more or less layers depending on the temperature for insulation.   My current setup is an under armour (Costco has great ones from a brand called 32 degrees or something like that), a Hot Chilis quarter zip, a vest that I got as a gift from Marker, and a patagonia poly fill that I swap out for down if it's cold all under my shell. If I'm in a GS suit it's mostly just the under armour and then two coats because it's a bitch to carry layers around as you have to shed them to race.	labels:	episode_done:True

I don't have a super-great grasp on what the formality levels are going to be at work yet, but I'm definitely hoping to get some great all-weather boots, some super warm leggings for non-work or work from home wear. The new job comes with a promotion so I'm going to need a few suits and some wool dress slacks for work (for those days when it's just too cold for anything else!).  I'm thinking a lot about velvet and knit and texture, trying to do longer (and warmer!) skirts than my usual pencil skirt without looking girlish or dowdy... and trying not to splurge on every coat known to man (four wool coats and a cape isn't too-too much, right?)

Alas. The styles changed just a bit, and now I can't find the plain white tanks and tees I want because the sleeves and the neckline and the length are all just a tiny bit off. Thank you for reading along, this not-a-real-problem is very frustrating at times.

text:What do you guys think about sites like Poshmark and Curtsey?	labels:I almost solely buy clothing from Poshmark, ThredUP and Depop. I like giving clothes a second life, and a lot of the time, when I find an item I like, the seller has more things so I bundle, save money, and I‚Äôm able to ship it all at once. I haven‚Äôt had many bad experiences with online secondhand sites and I‚Äôve used them for 6 years now.
text:Yep, I'd say 90% of my stuff is from Poshmark now. I only buy from brands Im familiar with so I know the sizing.  But it has saved me so much money and most of the time the stuff is like new.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:How do ya'll express your culture or traditional fashion in modern clothing?	labels:I‚Äôm Vietnamese, and I‚Äôve only recently been interested in my cultural clothing because of - well, internalized racism, which wasn‚Äôt great, LOL. But what I‚Äôve done is save up for custom √°o d√†i!  Traditionally, √°o d√†i is pretty eye-catching, especially in the U.S. (where I live). I‚Äôm saving up to create tailor-made √°o d√†i that‚Äôs more modern and something understated I could wear often: for example, switching out white silk pants for black ones, and the main dress for a crushed navy velvet. I find that modernizing cultural clothing can be a way to represent your cultural and ethnic roots without feeling strange or like an impostor, and seeing the same, familiar cuts in different prints and tones that I like fills me with a whole new type of joy.  I also follow other people who wear modernized cultural clothing. The first example that comes to mind is @asunnydisposish on Twitter, who is an artist but often posts pictures of her putfits (modernized hanbok). I have an album of Vietnamese clothing outside of √°o d√†i (like √°o nh·∫≠t b√¨nh) and other designers‚Äô takes on modern √°o d√†i, and another album of textures, prints, and fabrics I would kill to wear.   Other ways you can incorporate this into your clothing is supporting artists and designers from whatever ethnic group/culture you belong to!  If anyone‚Äôs interested in seeing the albums, I‚Äôm more than willing to share; I just don‚Äôt know how to operate imgur yet, which seems to be the go-to for everyone here. I hope this helped! Best of luck!
text:Vietnamese-American here! I would absolutely LOVE to see your albums and your finished piece!  I have about 5-7 ao dais that sit in my closet because I end up getting a few made every time I‚Äôm in VN (since they‚Äôre so much more affordable there) but then end up with very little occasions to wear them. I think this is a great idea and inspires me to think of how to wear it in a more modern way.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:How do you handle budget increases when it comes to clothes? (ex. going from student to working professional)	labels:Raising awareness of what I actually use.   Complimenting people's insistence that you budget, you also need to know where YOU will find the best VALUE of your wardrobe spending. What do you use? What are statement pieces of your fashion? What brings you the most joy?   * I have been using a closet inventory app. Stylebook tracks the costs and number of times I actually wear my clothes with which outfits too.   Although some styling habits might seem like common sense (like basic quality t-shirts and winter coating pay off), I learnt about other neat tendencies:  Scarves vs Sweaters. Scarves might seem more versatile and can pair with so many outfits for other people. But honestly, I live in sweaters.. maybe because it's cold... or maybe because I want to be cozy. If I didn't have the style app, I would probably think about 'investing' in a cashmere scarf. Now, I'm so much happier to budget for vintage pre-loved cashmere sweaters.   Do I even put on my accessories? Bracelets? Necklaces? Nope. Apparently throwing on colourful clothes is my go-to. I save so much money, not buying any jewelry - no bracelets, no necklaces, no earrings. (It makes my savings happier)  * I prioritize my next purchases from there.   The other thing I've invested in: **10x spending more in proper clothing care.** Proper laundry detergent, keeping old toothbrushes to scrub stains, a foldable drying rack, a sweater comb, and leather conditioners.   * Clothing care, only way to keep clothes looking professional and last.

I was in a situation where our team had won the match but because I wasn't playing \*as\* optimally as a few of my teammates would have liked, they all started trash talking me over voice comms after the match was over. It's such a bummer because it turns me off from wanting to play, even if I enjoy the game itself.  /end nerd rant

They are perfect -- straight (but still a little tapered), hits at my ankle for length, high rise, rigid denim. I have them in the Charleston Stroll wash which is a pretty standard blue jean color, but I have already looked at getting them in a black or gray wash for winter. A+ would recommend.
text:Hey, do you find that they stretch out in the waist after wear?	labels:Yep, just like the below comment said, I would def size down with my next pair but I personally don't find the stretch horrible.

If you really want to do this and are comfortable with it then by all means go ahead. But from my own experience I did this, and actually did it fairly well after many years, but at the end of the day it stood out too much in real everyday life in a normal town, regardless of how nice the outfit was, and it definitely hurt my social reputation a lot. After toning it down a bit I immediately noticed a difference in how much more positively I was treated by people. You can still dress well, but remember context is key.

Sometimes people are appreciating the design or color or novelty of an item and not the big picture of how it works for you.
text:>I‚Äôd also pay attention to the content of the compliment.  This is so interesting, but this is kind of hard too, sometimes. I had thought that maybe the novelty of the color was the reason for most of the compliments, but I have had several people who know me well also tell me that they like the color because it looks like it is natural and not like I dyed it (which, I guess is true since it is the result of a botched lightening job and not actual dye?).  Then again, these people also told me for years that they liked my bangs ... maybe they're all just benevolent liars. Unfortunately my hairdresser quit during the pandemic due to having a vulnerable family member so there's no one now I trust to tell me the truth about my hair.	labels:Well, I think it‚Äôs also important to recognize that people have different tastes and preferences. Lord knows I would never let my husband, who I love dearly, choose my clothes.   It‚Äôs also possible to have multiple things be true simultaneously. The color is unusual, it looks natural on you *and also* it‚Äôs not what you wanted (I‚Äôm guessing, based on ‚Äúbotched lightening job‚Äù).

I don't, for the LIFE of me, understand why Target, Gap, and all the other stores where normal people shop don't hold their own runway shows. Why don't they "show" at NYFW?

text:Are Luxury Fashion Brands Becoming Like Fast Fashion?	labels:Any time you're paying more than a few thousand dollars for a basic article of clothing, you're paying for the brand; because you could have that same blazer or pair of trousers custom made by a tailor/dressmaker in the same or better quality, for a lower price.  This was the case in the 50s and 60s as well, but at the time, high quality clothing was more common, sewing skills were more common, clothes were expected to last longer, and the general public had a better understanding of what good-quality clothing looks like; people bought Chanel expecting quality construction, of course, but the main appeal of buying from a prominent Parisian fashion house was knowing that anything Chanel made would be in fashion for the upcoming years.  Now that we are immersed in fast fashion, nobody has the knowledge to hold luxury brands accountable, and fashions change so quickly that a well-made 'up-to-date' jacket from a reliably fashionable brand would be a pointless investment.  It just doesn't make sense anymore for luxury brands to invest too much on quality if there is no longer any demand for quality.  This is not *only* a recent thing: I've seen gowns from the court of Marie Antoinette made of materials costing 30+ years of a working man's wages, yet were hastily thrown together with big, sloppy stitches and tacks.  That's just what happens when your client wants their garment *right now* and will only wear it once or twice.  If you want something that's really well-made and is going to last a long time, there is certainly a market niche for that, but it's become more of a middle-class niche for people who *specifically* care about quality and durability.
text:This was the case in the 50s and 60s as well, but at the time, high quality clothing was more common, sewing skills were more common, clothes were expected to last longer, and the general public had a better understanding of what good-quality clothing looks like; people bought Chanel expecting quality construction, of course, but the main appeal of buying from a prominent Parisian fashion house was knowing that anything Chanel made would be in fashion for the upcoming years.  \- But my question is how can fashion labels go back to this vision right here?	labels:When the people who buy Chanel products start caring about the thread count and style of hem finish used in their clothing, then Chanel will have to start caring about that as well.  But as long as they can sell cheaper clothes for the same price, then it would be silly to expect them to 'go back' to having higher business expenses.  So, really, you're asking for a societal change.  I think we're seeing more pushback against fast/disposable fashion in general, but we'll have to wait and see if that really takes off enough to the point where it changes rich peoples' buying habits.   There is that other issue, though:  \>  the main appeal of buying from a prominent Parisian fashion house was knowing that anything Chanel made would be in fashion for the upcoming years.  That depends on there being distinct fashion trends, and on people feeling compelled to follow them.  In the 50s and 60s, women had to comply with fashion trends in order to be accepted and respected within society.  Personally I'm quite glad that this is ~~no longer~~ less the case, but... well, now that it's less important to be on trend, it's also less valuable to be on trend.   Is it still worth paying thousands more dollars for a garment to be in style when nobody cares and the styles will change in a few months anyway?  If trends don't matter, then what is the point of shopping with a trendsetting brand?  Are brands like Chanel literally just depending on their customers buying solely for the sake of the label?  I guess that's another thing where we'll just have to wait and see if/how fast fashion destroys itself.  Maybe trends will regain some influence if they slow down, or maybe the trend bus will finally explode and people will just scatter into a multitude of alt fashions.  Either way I think there's a possibility for luxury brands to reestablish some sort of high style niche, but I would not expect (or want) them to have the same sort of leadership influence that they did in the 50s.
text:>the main appeal of buying from a prominent Parisian fashion house was knowing that anything Chanel made would be in fashion for the upcoming years.  Yeah Chanel and other fashion houses used to set the trends and it was up to you to make it into your own way. Fast fashion are the ones that are setting up trends same with fashion influencers. I just have more respect for seamstress creating timeless looks that will last a lifetime.  I agree I don't want them to dictate wants supposed to be in but I wish that a fashion brand like Chanel wasn't so cheap. They are raising prices because they want to be exclusive like Hermes yet everything right now is cheap and then conglomerates like LVMH care about profits and mass production its killing creativity and innovation.   This is why the fashion industry is where its at today. Even American Vogue is a shadow of its former self and Anna is the problem too.	labels:	episode_done:True

The luxury market is not trying to appeal to everyone; they don't have to work hard to do so.

text:what pieces/brands did you buy when moving from a warmer climate to a cooler climate? what did you end up regretting/not using?	labels:Many years ago I moved from Hawaii to college in the Northeast. I would recommend 1) Buying it all there, because they'll have what's good for their climate and 2) starting out with cheaper options (thrifted, Old Navy, Target range) even if it's not quite your style. Don't spend much time, effort, and money until you see how you really feel after at least a year of seasons. Maybe you want warmer stuff than you thought you would, or realize you should invest in nicer socks, or discover you don't actually like turtlenecks, or shift to a different style when you're surrounded by a new area's vibe. Let yourself experience it for a bit without pressuring yourself to do it all right.

Also synthetics textiles used for so many textile things around us daily life, that aren‚Äôt clothing, but were we are adding them in rubbish all the time and they pollution, and materials that won‚Äôt breakdown.  So choosing more natural fibre clothing helps balance out our excess use of synthetic fibres in day to day life, and feels better on body.
text:Oh right! I had forgotten about rayon being plant based.  True, the issue of synthetics isn't limited to fashion. There are plastics we use for shipping, shopping, and packaging, plastic toys, containers, decorations, accessories, etc. I agree that choosing natural balances the already overabundant use of synthetics.

text:Hair accessories - professional or should be saved for casual environments?	labels:I have no problem if it‚Äôs a neutral colored hair accessory.  Scrunchies feel more casual, but barrettes, thin hair ties, and headbands could be worn tastefully.  Color, if used, should be limited and not too distracting.    Example:    Red headband and the rest of the outfit is neutral. ‚Äî> sounds fine  Red headband, red lipstick, red necklace, orange shirt, zebra pants‚Äî> too much	episode_done:True

text:FAQ: How do I pick out my first suit for professional internships, interviews, etc.?	labels:I think that an under-discussed part of picking out a first suit for these types of things is getting out and trying them on before you buy. Being comfortable in a suit, even if it‚Äôs cheaper or in a less fashionable cut, is more important in interview settings than the eye to detail and quality that we normally discuss on here. A suit that fits in the shoulders, in a neutral color like navy or charcoal, that you know fits because you were able to try it on is way more important to your success than ordering something online that might be objectively better. Interviewers are looking for you to meet their minimum standard of professionalism, not for you to wow with with sartorial taste. Source: had a lot of interviews in college and law school.

text:FAQ: What is the difference between off the rack (OTR), made to measure (MTM) and Bespoke?	labels:/u/blackstrider has a great TL;DR but I'll add a bit more detail to MTM and Bespoke.  MTM: The pattern/style is generally pretty fixed, often there aren't fittings, and you make adjustments by changing standard measurements like "I want to add 0.5" to the leg opening". Pretty flexible format but I find it takes a couple of garments to really figure things out which can be tough.  Bespoke: Often a pattern is created for *you*, there are multiple fittings (in-person). This is where you can get really specialized tailoring looking at the pitch of you arms, how much you round your shoulders, etc. Bespoke tailors/cordwainers will also have styles that they specialize in so don't go to a tailor that specializes in structured "English drape" if you're looking for a casual unlined jacket or something.
text:I would make the analogy to a custom home.  There are your garden variety semi custom home builders that build large communities.

text:General Discussion - January 11, 2021	labels:2020 was probably the worst year of my life (most of the year was ok but nov/december was so awful it dragged it all the way down), but a serious silver lining was that i lost close to 35 lbs. i've been overweight pretty much all my life but not what most people would consider obese. still, it has always affected my self-esteem and confidence, and i was at my peak weight at the start of 2020, 235 lbs.  I cannot overstate how taxing it was to not see the scale budge downward for so long and always seemingly ticking up. a suit I had bought a year prior to fit comfortably after I gained weight was starting to not fit, real "ah shit here we go again" moment. at the start of the pandemic though, i lost 14 lbs in like two months and was ecstatic. i ticked another 10 or so lbs downward before I plateaued and you know, I was happy about it because I never felt hungry and I had a consistent lifestyle and it was good that I could live like that and not gain or lose weight at all. Then, I came down with food poisoning in december and barely ate for like a week and lost another 10 lbs (hardly healthy but in 2020 i'll take the good with the bad). Even after getting better and feeling good again I have kept that weight off and now weigh under 200 lbs for the first time in years. I'm ecstatic for more progress in 2021 and hopefully finally being confident enough to buy the dope clothes I want and not worrying that I look bad in them.  It's so interesting what relativity does to you. I'm 198 lbs rn, but I was last that weight when I was a senior heading off to college and felt awful about it. Now, I feel fucking great and way more confident than I was before. Funny things. The mission is 170 lbs but I'll be happy to be between that and 180. Sorry for the paragraphs but I know this forum more than almost anywhere will understand struggles like this, especially for guys.

text:How to build a style with a limited outlet?	labels:I've went through this myself, and the thing that has helped the most is to build that skill inside your head of "what does style mean to me?" The answer to this question is different for everyone, and you'll see it reflected just on the WAYWT threads - whether fashion is highlighting your existence in a certain social sphere, whether style is function over form, etc. What I did before my "outlet" grew was to source my inspiration online and think about pieces that I had and why I did or didn't like or wear them. You can do this with your existing wardrobe, or by window-shopping, which I know isn't so easy in COVID times, but you can do it online as well. What features do you love about your existing clothes? What defines "nice clothes" to yourself? I used to think that it was all about polished business casual clothing, because that reflected the work environments I had to survive in. Your staples will also be defined by what you think flatters (or unflatters!) you the most.  To be honest, I think style takes time; time to hone in on what you want or how you want to represent yourself. And if it doesn't take time, it does take money, and that's why being a stylist is a viable career path as well. But you do not need money to build or learn about style. My style has changed vastly from when I moved cross-country multiple times, and when I've changed careers. But style doesn't need to be static or done immediately. :)	episode_done:True
text:Is black tie comfort fashion a thing?	labels:Yes I call it formal pajamas. Brands like Johnny Was, Citron Santa Monica, and Eileen Fisher (her silk, velvet, and silk georgette). Plus the $$$ designer versions of these. A draped  band collar top in a brocade, and matching loose pants isn't quite black tie but it is formal!   For absolute black tie, I'd say maybe...Donna Karan Urban Zen + major jewelry. something like that. Like a full length avant guarde kaftan in shockingly expensive silk with shibori tie dye or something.  However perfectly fitted vintage clothing + sensitive skin likely isn't happening.   But you can translate aspects of that to your style---like for example you can get a full length ruched parachute silk skirt with granny boots and a draped lace top + a "mourning coat" for a funky "Magnolia Pearl" lagenlook formal style.	episode_done:True

text:The suit looks dark grey to my eye, though monitor may be misleading.  If it is indeed dark grey/charcoal, I would not recommend navy pants, I'd suggest a lighter grey with no pattern that is very noticeably lighter than the jacket. Agree with the above poster that the goal here isn't to match, but to contrast in a... Controlled... way, especially since you're planning for a funeral.  White shirt, simple/plain tie in any dark color (black or grey would be traditional for a funeral, but dark blue, burgundy, or dark green would be fine as well).	labels:I think navy is the right bet.

text:What are your fashion tips for looking good on Zoom?	labels:I think it's all in camera placement and lighting.  Have the camera at eye level or slightly above it. My laptop webcam was at a seriously unflattering angle, even when propped up. I just got a webcam that I put on my main monitor and the angle alone makes me look 10x better.   Get a light source behind your camera that's pointed at your face. Get a ring light if you can. Play around with desk lamps. If you have 2 lamps, try placing them behind the camera, one on each side of you. If you have 1, try placing it behind the camera pointed directly at you, try to bounce the light off the wall, etc. If you're sitting with your back to a window, close your blinds.  What color is your desk chair? Don't wear a shirt that's the same color. Other than that, I think anything goes with respect to fashion. You only really see like 10% of the person's top on videos.  Makeup wise, I like to wipe my face with an oil-blotting sheet to make sure I'm not shiny, lots of blush and bronzer, and  a YLBB shiny lip balm.	episode_done:True

text:Technical/Labwear but make it fashion	labels:I work in a physics research lab and I'm often the only woman in my workplace. For safety I always wear closed shoes and long pants, and for practicality I like pants with lots of pockets. Duluth Trading Company has the best women's pants I've found - I like the Flexpedition style the best but I have a bunch of them. You can get them for \~$40 when there's a sale and the pockets are huge! I also have some coveralls from them that I love because they come in an XS and actually fit me. I have to have my work special order things like gloves and safety goggles because the mens sized ones we had don't fit me. For shoes I like boots or sneakers and wear oxfords when I want to be fancy.  Most of the men just wear sneakers, jeans, and a t-shirt or flannel, so that's typically what I wear so I don't stand out too much. I also don't wear a lab coat at work, so my shirts often get dirty so I don't like to wear nicer clothes at work anyway. I'm comfortable with my androgynous style and don't feel pressure to dress up more. I just wear my nice sweaters and such on the weekend. I don't wear much jewelry anyway, and I actually got a pixie cut last year because I was tired of putting my hair up. Cute and practical!  The best work clothes tip I have is to keep a second set of clothes at work. A cardigan is especially important if you office is cold, and it can help dress up an outfit if you have a surprise meeting. I walk to work so I'm wearing snow boots in the winter and shorts in the summer, and then I just change into my work clothes and shoes when I get there.	episode_done:True

I don't know about the gossip, but to pull the plug without giving her employees the time to actually demonstrate their new vision, or even make preparations for being on the job market during a pandemic--maybe it's the behavior of a typical investor/owner, but it's not the "humble, always learning/growing" persona she has been putting out since the summer. I am a little tired of people getting away with cruel capitalist bullshit just because they are women. That's the whole "girlboss" conundrum and I'm glad it's dying out. I was excited to see what the staff did to turn the site around, but they weren't even given the chance. And this isn't corroborated, but if you tell your employees on Sunday the site is closing and less than a week later they get their severance and that's it, it seems to me like that is at least a potential indication of reactive, irrational and last minute decision making, if not a "tantrum."	labels:Yeah ngl, I am so completely disinterested in any form of feminism that's more aggrieved about one very wealthy woman being criticized with vaguely gendered language than it is about a whole bunch of financially precarious women on her staff having their livelihoods upended without warning in the middle of a pandemic winter. Who-owns-what-and-has-the-legal-right-to-lay-off-whom doesn't really factor into my moral reasoning either. If that makes me a crackpot, well, so are the people who actually wear these outfits in real life.
text:God, hear hear. Callous capitalist bullshit is despicable when it's done by and man and it's despicable when it's done by a woman. The brand was successful and there were a million ways to handle this that allows the writers at least a *fighting chance* of keeping their jobs. Honestly Manrepeller has always been like this: fun in a detached rich girl way, and this is probably the most appropriate way it could've ended.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Does anyone have a "uniform"?	labels:I wouldn‚Äôt call it a uniform per se, but I think I‚Äôm a very ‚Äúformulaic‚Äù dresser when it comes to everyday workwear and casual wear.   For a work day, it‚Äôs always black loafers + black pants + simple top, whether it be a sweater or blouse. I work in a very conservative industry but my office is usually pretty casual, so I find this formula is best for most days and I can throw on a blazer or heels I keep in my office if needed. I would hate to be in a situation where I have to run to a meeting short notice, which happens more often than I‚Äôd like to admit, and look like a sore thumb in terms of casualness compared to the other women in the room, who are usually a lot older and more advanced in their careers than I am. I pretty much only wear the same jewelry everyday for work too.   For going out and weekends, it‚Äôs usually fun shoes + jeans + nice top + a fun element, either a statement bracelet or statement earrings.   I think my style can get a bit predictable in that I own the same pair of black pants 4 times and 3 pairs of very similar loafers, but I have fun items like cheetah ankle boots I‚Äôm obsessed with to make it fun, but can also get away with for work. I echo previous comments about fussing over tops though with this formula, and the idiocy of men copying Zuckerberg or Jobs with the uniforms... don‚Äôt they realize that they don‚Äôt/didn‚Äôt look particularly good??	episode_done:True
text:Does Anyone Ever Feel Like It‚Äôs Hard to Find Basic Clothing Items That Were Plentiful in the Past?	labels:I don't know if I'd consider a velvet dress a basic item.  My basic item is a good quality fitted tee and tank.  Old Navy used to be the place to buy these things but their quality has gone downhill a lot.  I just want a tee or tank that is good for layering, but is not so sheer that I can't wear it alone.  Is something made with fabric heavier than tissue paper too much to ask?  (And by fitted, I don't mean the Everlane oversized/boxy fit.  If I wanted that, I'd shop in the men's section.)

text:Does change in climate = change in style?	labels:I think it did for me, however im trying to fix that. Id say my style in general is feminine/pretty and dressy. The weather in one location was mainly rainy, but also had alot of hills. So I ended up wearing jeans, a sweater/shirt and trainers for the majority of my duration there, unless I was going out. In that case, my style showed through more. Ive now moved back to my home country which has all seasons. During the summer, its hot so im normally in a feminine, flowy dress, but once winter hits, its just way too cold lol. Ill kind of go back to swearing jeans, a sweater and boots, but try to style it with more accessories (colorful scarf or a checkered jacket with some mid sized earrings). I bought a pair of knee high boots, a skirt and a couple thicker winter dresses this year to push myself to maintain my style whilst staying warm. We shall see if I stick to it, lol.	episode_done:True

I'm done with big sales.

I have one that's dark blue, so that's alright, but there are no pockets, which I miss. I like it because it's lightweight and versatile, you can easily wear it on its own (in the springtime/summer), but because it's oversized it also looks good with a lot of layers underneath. It's my favorite jacket I've owned so far (apart from a lightweight bomber) and I find it both stylish and useful. I also love long jackets.  edit: I did not see which sub I was in sorry. Nevermind me! it's still a good coat though.	episode_done:True

text:Discussion: LGBTQIA+ Signaling, Presentation, and Commodification in Fashion	labels:This is actually such an interesting topic. As a bisexual teenager i often fit the ‚Äúfashion stereotypes‚Äù of a bisexual because I look extremely different everyday. I dress in a number of styles, some being more masculine and some more feminine. I use pinterest for all my outfit inspiration, i never really think about whether or not it‚Äôs ‚Äúqueer fashion‚Äù, I just kind of like what i like.  I will say i consistently feel pressured to dress a certain way. Because I dress in a number of styles I‚Äôve realized the way you dress will tend to attract different kinds of people. For feminine women who like girls it‚Äôs hard to get attention from other women because most are going to assume that you‚Äôre straight.  Edit: Just letting everyone know because I think it‚Äôs funny. Ive recently noticed that i also walk differently depending on the way I dress. When i dress more masculine my walk is more relaxed, i have my hands in my pockets, and i slouch v.s. when i dress feminine i sway a bit when i walk and have good posture.	episode_done:True

text:Dae get overwhelmed by fashion?	labels:Hmm....I think when it comes to feeling like you don‚Äôt fit in fashion wise, it‚Äôs helpful to realize people aren‚Äôt as aware of the details and flaws as you are, and most people probably think you look fine, or more normal than you would think. Besides that, experimenting with different cuts of clothing can be really helpful in getting started. For example, if you‚Äôve been mostly wearing skinny jeans, you can try some more straight legged jeans with rolled cuffs and see how that looks. If you mostly wear tshirts, try tshirts in different cuts, or look for an outfit with a T-shirt on Tiktok or instagram, look for the details you like, then look for a T-shirt with similar details. Getting into fashion and finding a style involves experimenting, and starting with small changes with basics you‚Äôre already comfortable in might help with making fashion feel more natural.	episode_done:True

My feet still won't stop bleeding, socks on or off when I wear them. I wore them with thick socks for a while and now I can go sockless without cutting my heels, but there's still a pressure spot on my left big toe where the toe meets my foot. Its bad enough that it bleeds with most socks, and I can still feel something rough inside the shoe with thick socks on. I can't see inside the shoe but I don't feel any defects compared to the other foot, just rubs me wrong. Other foot is comfy.   Any advice on dealing with this?

Growing up I learned to wash everything together on cold. As an adult I had to read articles and watch YouTube videos on how to care for my clothing. I recommend everyone learn how to properly launder their clothing.
text:I agree, I've never understood what people are doing in the laundry to make their clothes literally fall apart after a few washes. Washing on the hottest setting and drying high heat, maybe?  Ive legitimately never had anything fall apart in the wash ever and I dont take particular care other than cold water and low heat in the dryer (plus not chucking things like sweaters, dress shirts and leggings in the dryer at all). And I used the communal machines in my apartment!	labels:The washing machine at my apartment is very rough on clothing. It's a top loader with an agitator and the machines are 'twin thin' (very small). My clothing goes through the ringer in that machine. I don't know how, but my clothing gets knotted up into a huge wet ball. Sometimes the clothing ball is stuck to the agitator and you just have to blindly yank around until it comes loose. But after I realized the machine sucks... I didn't put anything nice/delicate in it ever again.  So yeah.. If your washing machine sucks, hate to break it to you, but you need to hand wash anything you aren't willing to sacrifice to the laundry gods.

Here are some of the conventions that were adhered to:  A lady does not remove her hat when indoors or for the national anthem. This is in contrast to men, who are to remove hats when indoors and for the anthem. However, if you‚Äòre sporting a baseball cap at a ballgame, I would remove it for the anthem, whereas if you were wearing a more formal outfit with hat then I would not remove it.  A hat is a daytime piece in most cases not suitable for evening wear. The fascinator is an exception to this rule, but is more of a Commonwealth/British thing.  A lady does not wear a hat in her own home, ie when receiving guests, and as a guest in a friend‚Äôs home a lady would remove her hat.

Their 625 fill power is lower than other premium brands such as Marmot or Mackage, which both have 800+. And while they don't state their fill weight, I'm guessing it's pretty low as well considering how light their jackets are.  I just bought the Chateau, and compared to my Marmot which is both heavier and has a 800 goose down fill power, the CG is somehow significantly warmer in -5 to -15 temps.	episode_done:True

text:I actually hate my Ruggable. I love the design, but it is horrible for a house with dogs that shed a lot. The only way I‚Äôve found to get hair out of the rug is to get down and scrape it with my hands. Since using the vacuum with the brush (which would normally loosen hair) separates it from the Velcro and causes it to wrinkle, it‚Äôs impossible. Also, the edges are always rolling up.

text:What rules do you break for your body type?	labels:I'm short, and one of the fashion guidelines I tend to read say to create long lines - this means avoiding ankle straps on shoes. I LOVE ankle straps on everything - heels, flats, sandals, etc. I definitely ignore this rule! Another rule I saw was to avoid the midi length since it can sometimes be too long but not long enough to be maxi. I wear my midi length skirts high-waisted so they fall at the right point and I love them. IDC if they make me look short, they're gorgeous!
text:I'm also short and love a midi. I love them for practical reasons (maxis annoy me with all the fabric around my ankles, while I fear wardrobe malfunctions with shorter dresses) but I think they look pretty chic too.

I do think that if you‚Äôre just not going to choose separates over single pieces, foregoing them entirely is completely valid, once you‚Äôre not handicapping yourself. ¬†What worked for me, since I ended up with a ton of midi skirts I really liked, but felt apathetic towards tops, was to just go the solid colour, traditionally flattering route (which I think is the smartest way of tackling elements of clothing you don‚Äôt care that much for.) ¬†If I‚Äôm wearing separates, I‚Äôm always going to choose my bottom first, so not having to think much about what to pair them with is nice.	episode_done:True

They go like oh you can wear whatever you like but then they come up with 1000 rules about what should not be worn together. Anyway, if you like that style and also like to DIY things you can totally adjust regular items to look like Tibi ones. For instance, the asymmetrical shirt that closes a bit on the diagonal, the buttons that are used to pull up the sleeves, the ankle bands on some of their pants, etc. can all be recreated relatively easily and you don't need to spend 100s of $ on their "affordable" items (Amy's words, I always crack up when she boasts about how affordable Tibi clothes are).

text:Why are they 2-3 times the price of Uniqlo?   At 60quid a polo, they are competing with Kent Wang.  The traditional retail price is just insulting to anyone who makes clothes or works with cloth.	labels:Their clothes are made in Europe, the fabrics mostly traceable and they cover about 15 sizes. All things Uniqlo doesn‚Äôt do.
text:Clothes made in Europe is irrelevant.  Cloth quality, pattern complexity and quality of finish and stitching is the mark of quality.   Their Polo costs 18gbp to make, but they sell for 60gbp (3.1x the cost).  Their profit margin hints about what kind of market they are aiming at. This is why i said their traditional price is insulting to anyone who sews and works with cloth.   They are a high end fashion brand using sustainability as part of their brand marketing.	labels:A 70% margin is entirely normal and maybe low for some apparel products.

It feels really soft, might be close to cashmere in terms of softness. The knit is very dense, I sweat after 15 seconds of wearing it.

text:Brooks Brothers's Future Looks a Lot Like Menswear‚Äôs Past	labels:* Less SKUs. The amount of stuff BB sells is overwhelming.  * Do away with there weirdly named fit system. Change it to Extra Slim, Slim, Regular, Thicc Daddies * Revamp the BB website. It's been terrible for a long time. * Have the athleisure stuff, but also focus on high quality basics, again with less SKUs. Have something like an "essentials" line. The Navy Suit. The Charcoal Suit. The OCDB. The Chino. The Wool Trouser. Without fifty million variations thereof. You go now and it's like here are three navy suits with different kinds of stretch, here are four more with some kind of temperature controlling fabric. Just give me a half to full canvas lined 100% wool navy suit in various fits and sizes. In other words, simplify your menswear line to cut down on SKUs, and that will give you more room to play with sheep on skis and stuff (i think that does sound kind of cute, very Ralph Lauren). * Do away with Golden Fleece, Red Fleece. Mainline only. Again confusing to the consumer. * Where BB could play more is in areas like sport shirts. By all means offer your classics like blackwatch etc., but other menswear shops like Sid Mashburn or Todd Snyder offer all kinds of fun prints and colors while still feeling like classic #menswear.  i dunno, just riffing my own personal desires for BB. i don't know anything about running a large clothing manufacturer and retailer.

text:Effortless style - let's exchange tips and tricks	labels:Gonna weigh in for the fatties, nothing looks effortless, just sloppy and like you haven‚Äôt showered in 3 weeks unless you‚Äôve put in a maximum amount of effort into well fitting clothes, hair , nails, makeup , shoes and accessories. Every. Single. Day.  But I don‚Äôt have time for that BS.
text:Maybe because my feed is a lot of plus size/fat bodies, but I find this type of thinking terribly depressing. I won't pretend that terms like "effortless" are meant for us, but it also can feel even more exclusionary in a way when I see other fat people being like "never will I be considered to look this good!! no matter the effort I put in!!!".	labels:I think the point is just that the idea of "effortless" is completely void and that's best demonstrated through the fact that it crumbles completely when applied to a fat body. It's not the body, it's the concept.  Because it's not *actually* about the clothes, or about the attitude, or about any of that. It's literally just the thin, desirable body.  You can put sweatpants on it and call it "athleisure", you can wrap it in clingfilm and call it "sexy", or you can drape a burlap sack on it and call it "high fashion", but that's just people projecting bullshit concepts on a desirable body.   None of these things seem to exist or stand on their own, *unless* they're on a thin, conventionally "hot" body. When sweatpants are on Kendall, it's "athleisure". When they're on my lumpy thighs, they're just sloppy. When Glossier "makeup" is on a 17 year old model is cool and "effortless", when it's on an uggo, it's just...uggo.   It's not at all about the plus size bodies being somehow less than. Plus size bodies are not the problem. These meaningless concepts are the problem and it's in no way a negative reflection on the bodies, when the concept disintegrates on them.	episode_done:True

text:How have you changed your style and/or shopping habits after your body has changed?	labels:I went through this too, and while going through it, did an entire wardrobe overhaul. Instead of lamenting the weight gain, I chose to have a ton of fun buying new clothes for my bigger pandemic size. I‚Äôve had a great time eating really enjoyable food during quarantine, I don‚Äôt care that I‚Äôm fat now. Also, I had been ready to re-do my style for a while, and this seemed like the perfect time.   However, now knowing how easy it is to fluctuate in size, I used weight fluctuation as a deciding factor in what I chose to buy: I only purchased items that will fit with a fluctuation anywhere from 5-15lbs (I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2). Seems crazy, but it actually is possible. I stuck to either loose silhouettes, or tight yet forgiving stretchy styles.   What worked for me in choosing what I invested in was just ensuring I put enough time and effort into the process. I downloaded Pinterest and spent an inordinate amount of time looking at street clothes, I set a budget, thought about what items I needed, and did a ton of online window shopping. Once I had a better idea of what I wanted my new style to be, I did a lot of online shopping. I did return a lot of things, but also kept a lot, too.   Think about items of clothing that you gravitate towards, that make you feel really good. Use that to form the basis of your wardrobe. The process does take time and effort, but doing enough prep before buying will really make the process way easier.
text:I love the eye for clothing that will fit with a weight fluctuation -- especially since I am now trying to be a bit more conscious of that! Do you have any particular examples of items that have worked well for you?  I think part of my problem is that the silhouettes that used to work for my pear/hourglass body now do not at all with a bigger stomach, and it's slow to figure out what will. The other part of the issue I'm finding is that clothes quality and silhouette fit is a challenge in plus sizes for me, even with brands I trusted before. I'm having issues with things riding up or sliding down over time even when they seemed my proper size.	labels:I‚Äôm also an hourglass/pear! In terms of oversized fits, I made sure everything I bought hit me at my smallest spot so that it looked correct for my shape. For example, I bought an oversized cashmere sweater, and it ends mid thigh. I wear it with tight pants (I often follow the baggy top/loose bottom vice versa) and a shoe with a heel to balance it out. The sweater is big enough to fit a huge weight range and still look good. Oversized is in, and I think it looks trendy.   In terms of plus size clothing, I haven‚Äôt yet ventured into that because I stuck to brands that offered already oversized clothing. The sweater I mentioned is Ben Taverniti (bought on deep discount) and was already marketed as oversized, so I bought the biggest size and it fits great. It‚Äôs an easy way to not have to find new brands or learn how to style yourself with plus sized clothing.	episode_done:True

text:Arc'teryx Radsten Parka (2020) Review	labels:For what it's worth, I have the camosun, one level up in warmth from the radsten. Uses a slightly thicker synthetic insulation and also adds some down, and it keeps me comfortable down to -20C easily, no matter how much wind there is.  Otherwise a lot of what you mention here is valid in terms of construction between the two coats.
text:yeah the camosun might have been a slightly better fit for me. I am pretty happy with my radsten anyway, but wouldn't go any colder with it then the weather in vienna rn. When ordering I was afraid that the camosun would be too warm, which I think it could also very well be. So I chose the one where I thought that it would maybe be a bit too cold instead of too warm and having to sweat. I think that I might pick up a good fleece or thermal underlayer and that should do the trick for the cold days. :)	labels:That's a really good point!  I only start to wear the camosun around 0 degrees and have other lighter coats for above that. Really depends on what your needs are, since winter in Canada can get a bit more extreme than austria.
text:yeah the only other jackets I have (besides the UNiqlo one that I hate) is just a very light nike acg jacket with primaloft insulation and an old lightly insulated barbour coat which I had to wear together at about 5C.

text:What materials are worth paying more for? What equals quality?	labels:Fabric quality is about more than the specific fibers used, which makes it difficult when all that‚Äôs listed is fiber content. High-quality rayon can be more luxurious, more durable, and easier to care for than low-quality silk, to give one example.  And cut and finish are equally important to garment quality. These aren‚Äôt easy to assess just from photos on a website, unfortunately.   One red flag for poor quality is if clothes look rumpled or stiff on the model. Another is if the fabric around the seams seems crinkled, like it isn‚Äôt sewn evenly.  Reading reviews can also help, or coming to forums like this one to ask for people‚Äôs experiences.

text:Have you ever participated in a clothing swap - in person or online?	labels:In the Before Times I would host one or two per year--I would make a facebook event and invite maybe 20 people (and just text friends who didn't have social media) and I'd usually get around 10 folks that showed up. I usually served mimosas and encouraged people to bring hors d'oeuvres so that it was also a little brunch gathering too. Some of the pieces I got from those have given me the most mileage over the years, and often they're items I never would have thought to look for!   I don't know if I'd do the digital ones, feels more like thrifting given the shipping cost and these days I prefer to buy secondhand via poshmark and whatnot since I am better able to find exactly what I'm looking for. Personally I'd be comfortable right now with an in person swap that takes place entirely outside (with mask required to use the bathroom) with a very small group of people I know, but I don't want to put pressure to do that on anyone else so I've just donated my clean-out clothes. Plus half the fun is trying something on and having your friends help you decide to keep it or leave it, and I don't know how I'd make that work outdoors. God I miss pre-2020...
text:I'm also curious if there are any items that stick out that you got or swapped!	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Does anyone else have this style issue?	labels:This is pretty much what finding your style is.  You're taking what you like or whatever vision you have in your head, and combining it with your reality; your budget, your time investment, your lifestyle, & your actual body.  That said, it's not impossible to pull of a specific look, but if it plays against your strengths, but it's going to be more of a time investment to get it right.  The most efficient way to do this would be to learn how to sew, so that you can either tailor or make everything yourself.  Alternatively, you've got to try on a ton of clothes to get the fit you wan,t and probably still need to get things tailored.  There are a ton of ways that you can get an outfit to lean one way or the other, either through styling or accessories.  Personally, I love a good menswear inspired look; but I don't love it on my body and I'm not gonna be bothered with finding curvy, petite pants when I don't even particularly like pants.  However, chopping off my hair really helped me feel a lot more comfortable wearing more feminine silhouettes without it feeling so feminine.  It might make sense to pick out the elements that work for you (colours? materials? tops?) and mixing it with other things that you like/work for you body.	episode_done:True

text:Fashion Favorites	labels:Definitely wool coats‚Äîthe longer the better, preferably with nice sharp shoulders and a big collar that stays up if you pop it. Blazers, too: anything with strong shoulders, a nipped waist and a slightly longer length.   Silk scarves and vintage clip on earrings‚ÄîI have a bit of an obsession with both. The combination can dress up a lazy outfit in seconds, in a way that's appropriate for any occasion.  Flowy midi skirts and dresses, especially pleated or wrap-around designs. Much more comfortable than jeans, and eye-catching, too.  Blouses: button-front silk shirts, cotton Liberty prints, and anything white/cream with lace or ruffles.  And because we're still in a pandemic...silk satin face masks. I've actually enjoyed matching them to my outfits!

text:Formula for a put together outfit that works for most aesthetics	labels:I think this strongly depends on your natural features. E.g. I have an hourglass figure with noticeable boobs, so if I'm wearing something fitting it's already like 4 points, lol, even if it's a simple black dress. If I'd put 7 more "points" worth of accessorizes and stuff that would turn me into overly feminine very much in your face type of appearance. So I usually have my outfit - fairly simple but fitting, some makeup on the face, and everything else is a bit toned down, e.g. simple jewellery, maybe a pendant or earrings, simple hairdo, etc. If I had less prominent features, the "blank slate" model look I feel I could push further with adding scarves, bags, more jewellery, etc. But being curvy even red lips become kind of a provocation.	episode_done:True
text:Is 2020 the year of the 'house dress?' On comfort as a 'trend'.	labels:These kinds of dresses are really popular in Japan as casual wear. Many women will wear them around the house or just to run Errands. Often they are worn with leggings for a comfortable look with the fit often being slightly oversize. This is possibly as close as we will get to comfort fashion/athleisure in Japan. The style borders with the Mori girl (forest girl) look which favors loose dresses in natural fabrics.   &#x200B;  Look at shops like Uniqlo or Muji - the womenswear section always has a few in stock all year round. I myself own quite a few of these type dresses to wear at home, on weekends and to work.  &#x200B;  In my office today, all the women are wearing some sort of loose fit dress because it is hot as balls outside.	episode_done:True
text:How do you shop for specific things without google clogging up with items from fast fashion? Or. How do you find the real designer of a fast fashion item?	labels:On Poshmark or eBay, I set a minimum price to filter out the worst of it. On eBay, you can also search specifically for pre-owned items, which might also help depending on what you're looking for. (Vestiaire and TRR have much less of it.)

You're buying SLP because it's SLP (or Ackermann, or Dick Ovens, or whatever your thing is). *That* is the justification. And that's a fine justification in and of itself! An analysis of the materials and construction is unlikely to throw up surprises that'll make people go "damn, that really makes it worth the obnoxious price tag!"

text:Lessons from a Year of No New Clothes	labels:Your post really resonated with me. First and foremost, hats off to you, for real. I definitely would not consider a no-buy during 2020 easy, at ALL. Yes maybe on a superficial level it would seem so since we are all just sitting around in onesies watching Netflix, but shopping - especially for new clothes - is an extremely effective way to self-soothe and lord knows we have needed a lot of that in 2020.   I personally broke up with fast fashion in 2019 during my second pregnancy (which really was easy in a way, because I didn‚Äôt actually fit into anything so it was difficult to justify purchasing new clothing). I‚Äôve had a few weak moments but have discovered sewing/dressmaking. It is really exciting in its own right because, as you said, I actually have a personal style and a lot of my dream pieces are actually super attainable. It also just feels so good to finally be outside of the hamster wheel of endless trends, sales, promotions, influencers, newsletters, marketing and whatever else have you. Good luck in 2021!	episode_done:True

text:How do you think access and privilege affect your taste and sense of style?	labels:To put it bluntly, 100% privilege plays a role in the way people dress because there is increased access to options (including natural fibres, so called ‚Äúsustainable‚Äù clothing, tailoring, etc) that are completely inaccessible for the majority of others.
text:100% on privilege. Over the past few years, I‚Äôve slowly transitioned much of my wardrobe to natural fiber clothing (with the exception of athletic wear - but now there‚Äôs recycled options at least!). And I know it‚Äôs a privilege to do so, now that I‚Äôm further in my career. A $300 slow fashion, locally produced w/ fair wage, pasture raised wool sweater simply isn‚Äôt accessible for most. And even secondhand, it‚Äôs not cheap by any means. This is why as problematic as Everlane is as a brand, I won‚Äôt judge someone for buying a much more affordable wool cardigan there instead of from babaa, if it better fits their financial needs.  However, trends are for sure more physically accessible now than before with e-commerce and social media, for better or for worse. It‚Äôs interesting - I‚Äôm in my early 30s, so our generation was in jr high / high school just as e-commerce was starting. We were one of the first Facebook user cohorts. I grew up in a sleepy suburb that was ~2 hours from a large city. We had an OK mall, Macy‚Äôs was our fanciest department store. Whenever a girl wore something from Nordstrom‚Äôs, everyone oohed and ahhed because not only was it more expensive, but you had to be fairly privileged to travel to the city to go shopping.   I still remember our family visiting my older brother in another major city, and he took me to an Urban Outfitters store for the first time. I thought all the clothes were _so cool_ and how awesome that the people had local access to that store?? And now it‚Äôs both visually and ‚Äòphysically‚Äô accessible through the internets (with their problems as well). In that sense, I do think it‚Äôs great - but the trade-off is the exacerbation of fast fashion with trends cycling through and consumed at lightning speed.	labels:I lived in South Carolina in high school. There was only one Gap in the entire state (at near peak Gap trend). We‚Äôd be so excited to have a field trip on the other side of the state to go to the good mall that had a real music store and the Gap.	episode_done:True

Focus on quality fabrics and construction, and get to know a few brands whose aesthetics and quality you like, and you‚Äôll be set. With apps like Poshmark, it‚Äôs easier than ever to build a quality wardrobe for next to nothing - just learn your measurements so you can better approximate fit.	episode_done:True

text:Just how revolutionary is Harry Styles‚Äô Vogue cover?	labels:I like the gesture a lot and things like this make me as a queer person feel more safe...  *however*, that doesn't stop me from saying I think this shoot was poorly styled. The looks just don't do it for me and in some ways they look incomplete. It looks like he decided to wear a dress the day he showed up to the shoot. It just seems, for lack of a better term, lazy. Like they didn't really care what this meant. He needed more hair and makeup work in my opinion. Something to make people look at it and be like "wow, he looks really pretty and I bet he feels it‚Äù  or some eye color would've pulled the whole thing together. Or a pretty necklace! I think lacking these little details is why people will say he didn't pull it off and is sort of a let down considering what this symbolizes. Open to hearing from other people who support the look, tho
text:I like it precisely because it looks slightly unfinished or unconsidered. Harry Styles has a really intense stylist and it‚Äôs vogue, there is absolutely no chance that these outfits were not considered to death by a bunch of really knowledgeable people.   He is definitely not meant to look pretty, and to me that‚Äôs part of the point. He‚Äôs just ... wearing a dress. It doesn‚Äôt even really look feminine per se, which I guess is what you‚Äôre reacting too. I think the point was really to not associate the dress with femininity, but to just treat it as another piece of clothing. That‚Äôs kind of how he deals with his sexuality: he studiously avoids making any statements whatsoever.   I think the place that I see something historical is not in the dress but in the fact that it‚Äôs a vogue cover. I don‚Äôt know if this was a one time thing or if vogue is going to now be more gender diverse with their cover models. To me that‚Äôs the question: is the point that he is a feminine man or rather that Vogue can set these categories aside on one of their covers, which is a really culturally significant object.  This made waves precisely because it was a Vogue cover. He has worn dresses before without this reaction. But it doesn‚Äôt clarify vogue‚Äôs position on gender really. My sense is that to they will occasionally feature male-identified models on their cover, and just generally observe more fluid norms around gender. In a way Harry is just the tool for Vogue to make a big move within their own history, maybe...	labels:Thanks for that response. I can totally see how my angle was gendered. I was projecting my personal aesthetic and not considering the greater statement. I‚Äôm glad it resonates with you both symbolically and in the visual presentation. I love conversations like this.
text:Yeah I like conversations like this too. I can suddenly see how it would just like weird and uninteresting if you had pretty clear gender categories. I feel more in the mix like he seems to, so it definitely does resonate with me. I think the thread below is interesting too, that it‚Äôs because he was seen as a hot male celebrity in One Direction and has gradually wound up wearing a dress on the cover of Vogue. I am not actually a super radical gender person, but there is something about Harry Styles that resonates extremely strongly with me. I frankly can‚Äôt say why.  The ppl in the other thread are emphasizing how there‚Äôs nothing inherently new about what he is doing but I disagree. I think he represents a very widely-consumable version of a gender queering position. He is at once legible as a British rock star and something very contemporary. It comes back to the sense of insouciance. I know everything he is doing is deliberate, but his attitude is that none of it should matter. I think other instances of celebrity gender bending were framed as being subversive, whereas he is trying to treat us as precisely not subversive but nothing. It‚Äôs a complicated move, for his radical thing to be to pretend that what he is doing isn‚Äôt radical. But for me it works and is quite smart and meaningful (even if it is, as the ppl in the other thread are saying, a series of calculated decisions, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs only that. I think he is following something genuine and internal, even if he is a professional concerned with having a successful career. He does strike me as being actually genuine in a sort of rare way. Idk. This was a long response, which shows how intensely his dress thing is impacting me.	labels:I‚Äôm glad you feel safe to express yourself here. I like what you had to say. I work to live without gender categories and I definitely projected just some of my aesthetic choices. I go for polished looks that are ‚Äúcomplete‚Äù from head to toe so my first reaction was ‚Äúneeds some makeup‚Äù. But you‚Äôve pointed out it‚Äôs more of a dejection of all that instead of just putting together a feminine look.   I wanna pose a question to you. Do you like Harry as the subject for something like this over someone like Billy Porter? Why or why not?	episode_done:True

text:How do comfort vs. style compare in what bottoms you wear?	labels:I mostly wear jeans/pants and I find them to be very comfortable personally. I'm honestly always a little surprised that they're so uncomfortable for most people. Most of my discomfort in skirts/dresses is mental (I just don't feel like me when I wear them).   I think if you enjoy wearing skirts you should keep wearing them, nothing wrong with that. If it's a seasonal thing maybe fleece stockings or something like that will allow you to wear them in the cooler months.
text:I think it could be because skirts and dresses more easily fit a wider variety of body proportions, especially if it's mid-length and loose at the hip. With trousers and jeans you add in the factor of thigh size, calf size, rise, inseam length... more factors that can mess up the fit and be uncomfortable if you aren't "average".  Personally, unless they're very stretchy, I have never found a single pair of jeans or trousers that fit well off the rack without a lot of tailoring. Like, they are completely unwearable. So dresses and skirts are just easier from that perspective.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Can you have a clothing style without actually wearing that certain style much?	labels:This isn‚Äôt a direct answer to your question, but I‚Äôve found I have a ‚Äòhopeful‚Äô sense of style and a ‚Äòrealistic‚Äô sense of style.  Hopeful-me will think about buying a teal floral wrap dress because it‚Äôs gorgeous. Realistic-me knows it will sit in my closet untouched for 3 years because I don‚Äôt wear teal!   I‚Äôve learned to differentiate between the two while I shop, at least. If I was a celebrity suddenly, maybe I would lean towards hopeful-me‚Äôs style, but for now I am normal and realistic!
text:It took me years to figure this out! I love shopping for my aspirational life where I host elegant but casual outdoor dinner parties, wear tasteful, high end fashion, risk getting snapped by the paparazzi when I leave a store, and don't profusely sweat when it's over 75 degrees. But in reality, I am a lawyer who spends the time I'm not wearing suits, wearing mostly athleisure since my real life activities are working out, taking our dog to the park, hiking, and sometimes working on cars.   For me, it's been helpful as I've developed my style to create go-to outfits that make me feel put together based on various occasions that I actually would need to wear (at least, pre-CoViD): work dinners, running errands when it's hot out, brunch with friends, etc. I also have found my style has changed over time as I go through various seasons of life.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:A discussion about ‚Äúknockoff culture‚Äù	labels:Most designs are not unique imo.  Designs and inspiration is a grey area.

I‚Äôm all for affordable options when it‚Äôs not plagiarism, I love fashion but it can be overpriced and elitist.  And accessibility for people who don‚Äôt want to spend ridiculous amounts on designer clothes is a plus to me, I know that‚Äôs controversial.  Honestly some of the most heinous and shameless theft of ideas often comes from big designers.  I don‚Äôt think that first top is even something original enough to be stolen.  It‚Äôs a v backless ribbed bodysuit, right?  Common, simple fabric/pattern.  The sweater is *slightly* more unique but imo just a few common trends put together.  And the other sweater doesn‚Äôt really look much like it imo.	episode_done:True

I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs not everyone‚Äôs style, but I found a bunch of basically new stuff at a thrift shop for $2 a piece the other day: an Eileen Fisher silk undershirt, 2 Eileen Fisher all-wool pants, 2 Pendleton blazers, 1 pair of Pendleton slacks, an all-wool Valerie Stevens jacket, a cashmere shrug, a virgin wool sweater, an angora sweater, and 2 pashmina scarves. I also found 2 pairs of life strides heels in my size for $.50 each. It was a good day.   But that‚Äôs not all!   I popped in to the mall after, and the New York & Company was closing. Everything was 70-90% off. Normally I wouldn‚Äôt shop there because of the quality / age target, but they had a decent collection of accompanying items I could wear with nice blouses. Got 2 ginormous sacks of clothes for about $200. About 10 pairs of pants, 3 pairs of shoes, 2 earring sets, 3 blazers, 4 cardigans, 2 dresses, and 5 tops. Noice.  I was really worried I‚Äôd need to spend a fortune on updating my wardrobe. I was so relieved I caught a break.

I also think that how long an item lasts is more important so you‚Äôre not replacing every month or so.

text:Best White T-Shirts for Men 2021 - Wirecutter	labels:I am currently wearing a Lady White Co white t shirt, I love the fit and material.. but I dyed it brown lmao.  These are great t shirts, except something about them is just impossible to keep white. Maybe they havent been bleached as much ,or for some reason the fibers absorb more color, but it has been a real pain since day one. I don't really understand it  After the first wash left these weird extra white blotchy patches, which only showed up in direct sunlight. After many washes, these seemed to have gone away, though I'm not sure if the overall color has changed.  These shirts are constantly getting discolored by the wash (admittedly high in iron), and picks up all sorts of residue from the drying rack, or normal wear. Compared to every other white garment I've had, they are just super finicky. Like, its not ever been an issue with my other shirts, but these are always finding new stains to show off. One might say that I'm more critical of a $50 shirt than a $10 one, but I feel like this is an objective observation.  Ultimately, I'm much happier having dyed them to other colors. I prefer clothes which look better with age, so I tend to avoid white generally, but these are extra frustrating given the price and the hype. It dosnt matter to me how great the construction or fit is if they are a pain to keep clean.  The article says they are "offwhite", maybe this has changed? I feel like mine were very white to begin with.  It makes me wonder if something is different about the bleach or dyeing method compared to other brands	episode_done:True

text:MFA Brand MegaReview: Drake's | January 16, 2021	labels:I really love my items from Drake's (pretty much all bought on sale). I have a red lambswool jumper with a high crew neck, which isn't the easiest to wear with shirts but would be okay if it had a high enough collar. Had to have it repaired (didn't notice holes in the factory shop) and the repair was excellent - knew where the holes were and had trouble finding them still. I have a selection of neckties from Drake's which I haven't had a chance to wear yet but they have a nice heft and they feel lovely. I also have a purple 70% cashmere 30% silk scarf which is absolutely wonderful to wear.
text:One thing I really want to highlight with Drake's is that while the value proposition is reduced in terms of the items themselves (e.g. soft shouldered tweed jackets, etc) due to new competitors, Michael Hill's eye for colour is still one of the best in the game. His choice of pattern is amazing too, striking just the right balance between stodgy and kitschy to achieve a real sense of fun and enjoyment out of a more dressed up look.	labels:An example of this is the first Drake's shirt I bought - a cranberry + white university stripe oxford shirt. I stumbled across it in their London shop on sale 5 or so years ago in the dead of summer, and in the subsequent years have appreciated how many things it goes with - sure navy sport coats, but also greys, greens and browns all can work as well.     I bought it because it was beautiful and well constructed, but over time I have come to appreciate how versatile it is, when "cranberry and white stripes" probably wouldn't make many "Top 10 Shirts for Work" lists	episode_done:True

text:How many distinctly different outfits do you have?	labels:I don‚Äôt think you should have to change unless you wanted to:) You sound like you have a fantastic wardrobe that works for you and brings you joy. I also love neutrals, wines, and forest greens and I don‚Äôt think there is anything wrong with it!   Perhaps some people might not notice, but the same people may not notice even if you had a diverse wardrobe because they may not be too interested in clothing in general. So please don‚Äôt let that discourage you.  I think it‚Äôs lovely how you pick clothes that have details that set them apart from others, and I think the people you meet often or people who enjoy style and clothing may notice and appreciate the differences.   There is also quite a large capsule wardrobe community these days so you might find that interesting. Everyone does it a little differently so you might want to browse around a bit to find someone who does something similar (some are more rigid than others), but capsule wardrobes tend to have focus on quality over quantity, and appreciating the smaller details. Maybe you‚Äôll find some inspiration without any pressure of having to drastically change your wardrobe;)	episode_done:True
text:Why Did Bottega Veneta Delete Its Social Media Accounts?	labels:All these thinkpieces serve to do is mystify a transparent marketing strategy dovetailing neatly with the ethos of the brand. As a brand Bottega Veneta is fashion's equivalent of your friends on social media who announce to the world that they're going to be moving in silence from now on  ‚Äì a brand for those who want to be lowkey, *but not really*.  Social media makes sense for brands like LV for whom the core ethos is in your face flaunting, as Instagram is both chief flex medium and ultimate marketing tool to an aspirational public. Bottega Veneta's courtship is a bit different. If I'm BV I don't even want to be seen as attempting to court that customer, and so the retreat from social media makes sense considering the brand's appeal to aspirational customers who want to be perceived as more sophisticated than those of LV. In reality BV is every bit as accessible before (just type it into the search bar) but it's the *illusion* of withdrawal which is key, both in attracting more aspirational customers and retaining your seasonal clients, for whom discretion ‚Äì especially in LVMH's major growth market of China ‚Äì is key.  I don't have any experience in marketing or the luxury sector but what this tells me is that LVMH believes either that a social media presence was a waste of resources or that this'll help cultivate a fake sense of "in the know" among their growth demographic, particularly with COVID exposing the full extent of income inequality's social rot.  Considering influencer fraud, flexing, and the danger of being mixed in with the bland minimal luxury aesthetic running rampant on IG, it makes perfect sense for them to pull back.  &#x200B;  TL;DR: It's just good marketing. The brand will still be very present in all the relevant outlets that actually generate sales.
text:Bottega Veneta is owned by Kering but yeah the same thing still applies to them too.  I noticed that right after Phoebe Philo left Celine and that brand changed the whole look with Hedi Slimane, there was influencers on social media etc calling BV the 'new Celine' and hyping the brand, it was getting pushed on places like GQ and other mags too. Maybe that was an organic shift and the Phoebe Philo Celine fans just wanted a new brand to love after she left but also, it could easily be inside marketing from BV and Kering to take advantage of that space. And I remember Celine never used to have an Instagram page, social media or much of an online presence at all that kept it kind of mysterious, now BV is trying that. More than a coincidence?	labels:Bottega being positioned as the 'new celine' had a lot to do with Daniel Lee taking over at BV who had previously worked under Phoebe at Celine. It was definitely deliberate positioning but the appointment of Daniel Lee meant it had some credibility to it rather being just purely buzzwords.	episode_done:True

text:General Discussion - January 19, 2021	labels:I never thought I'd become this person, but man, shipping costs really can fuck up my desire to buy something. I was just about to commit to buying another pair of sneakers and it's probably the best deal I'm going to find on them, added to cart, shipping info entered, billing info entered... $20 for the cheapest shipping option. No shipping codes available, no threshold I can cross to get free shipping. $20 period, no exceptions.  It's a $300 pair of sneakers discounted to $180, I guess should be able to rationalize that at $200 (including shipping), I'm still getting a better deal than what's available anywhere else online (only a few select retailers got this colorway, and all but one are sold out in my size), but still, $20 shipping feels *wrong*. My brain has been trained from years of online shopping that there should always be some way to get around paying for shipping, or otherwise, shipping should be cheap.

He‚Äôs hit a growth spurt recently and I‚Äôd like to move his wardrobe to more sensory friendly/ easier to dress himself clothes. He's going to have enough hardships in life, I figure that his clothes don't need to be one of them. It would also be pretty amazing if we could help him develop his own sense of style!  I think that there are pieces in streetwear that would be much easier for him to use than the jeans, flannel and laces boots that I wear. Seriously, this old millennial hipster basically looks like the token bearded bastard on every small batch beer label.  I‚Äôm looking for a starting place to find affordable pieces that I can help him start building a new wardrobe out of.  His needs: No buttons, no laces that need to be tied  His preferences: He doesn‚Äôt like material touching his calves with the exception of pjs, he dislikes wearing socks or shoes that go above his ankles  His likes: Space, nerd culture, kind messages, bright colors and fun graphics  Side note, my wife was recently diagnosed with cancer for the second time so our budget is really tight with her upcoming treatments.  If you made it this far in my post I appreciate your heroic effort! Thank you for any help you can provide.

text:Women who have moved for extended periods of time on 1 or 2 suitcases only, how did you do it? Here's the beginning of my process	labels:How permanent is the move? If it's only a couple of months then you could also just bring a couple of basic items and leave space in your bag to buy new clothes in your destination. This is what I did when I studied abroad for a year. The clothes are then also a nice souvenir for yourself.   If it's a long term or permanent, again just bring the things you absolutely love the most then buy things there. You can also have your other closed shipped to you in a parcel if you really can't do without them. Obviously if it's a permanent move the issue of fitting everything in a suitcase to bring home isn't really an issue.   Depending on what climate your moving from and to you might find you don't have enough clothes for said climate. For example, I moved UK to Japan, and I absolutely did not have enough clothes for the hot, humid summers here.  The same goes for culture. Many of my friends ended up having to throw away all of their tanktops and lowcut blouses because they're not culturally appropriate here.   It's also really common to change size when moving to another country because of diet and lifestyle changes. So you could find that all the clothes you bring no longer fit you after a few months.  The only longterm move situation where it's better to bring everything is if it'll be difficult to find your size where you're moving. For example if you're 6' and moving to east asia you'll have a hard time finding clothes

text:How to combine colors	labels:OP this isn't directed towards you specifically, but the biggest issue with color theory stuff I have is the lack of why. Nobody can tell me why these colors don't work with this undertone besides saying that color isn't suited for that undertone and then when you push further what they mean is that color generally makes people of that undertone look more yellow which we associate with being sick to which I have to ask why that matters if you can tell the person isn't sick (edit: I also don't agree with this statement that yellowing in a person's skin makes them look sickly people don't change skin color because of illness unless you have gout or something).   I guess what I'm getting at is the premeditated goal when talking about color theory almost always seems to be less about how/why colors work and more here's how to look most conventionally attractive and that's an issue because then these guides can become prescriptive real fast and new users then cling to these rules and it stunts creativity. (I know one of your links mentioned specifically NOT sticking with only colors that work with your skin tone which was great to see, but most didn't)

text:Have your clothing purchases dramatically dropped now that we can't go anywhere?	labels:Only certain places in the world have big lockdowns. Where I live people are free to go to restaurants, bars, movies, small parties etc. with social distancing measures in place and most everyone who worked in an office is back at the office at least part time, so I think it‚Äôs a bit of an oversimplification to say no one can go anywhere.

text:Top Down / Aerial / Crotch Shot WAYWT	labels:This is literally me every day at work before Covid.	episode_done:True
text:Knit Tie Inspo / Lookbook	labels:I picked up a black knit tie and a navy knit tie at the same time. While for normal woven ties, I'd usually reach for a navy over a black, with the texture of a silk knit, somehow the black knit tie just looks better than the navy knit in so many outfits.   This might be a function of bias because I've read articles extolling the virtues of the black knit tie, but I think the texture of the knit helps to offset the starkness of the colour
text:That's very interesting. I find black (and actually yellow too) to be very difficult colours to try and work with. Black especially just seems very stark, as you rightly said, but it's interesting that you mention it working better than navy as I have found my navy one very versatile.  I'd be very interested to see some fits with them in your own distinct style and see what you do with them.	labels:	episode_done:True

I especially right now love a tight black turtleneck, loose vintage jeans and black combat boots.  In the summer I really like off-shoulder tops bc it shows skin without it being cleavage.    I only show cleavage in a loose top. I have a chiffon skinny strap flowy top that I love wearing all seasons with or without a cardigan or denim jacket. I also have linen long sleeve top with bell sleeves that is very cleavagey in a flattering way.    Hope this gives you some inspo! I don't have pics but if you put some of the descriptors I used +outfits on Pinterest, that could help!	episode_done:True

text:Does change in climate = change in style?	labels:I moved from a place which has four seasons but it often grey and overcast to a place just a little north of the tropics with a lot of heat and sun. I still favour similar shapes but now in much lighter fabrics. The biggest difference has been the amount of colour in my wardrobe. I‚Äôve gone from a mainly navy and blacks colour palette to wearing such a variety.

Sure, you might not see many of them out on the Appalachian Trail or Pacific Crest (though I could arguably see many of those pieces being perfectly functional for actual hiking), but you also aren't likely to see anybody wearing shipster/nautical workwear out on a trawler in the North Atlantic. That's not really the point. I think most everything in this album would be acceptable "outside the context of a fashion magazine" for people who are into the aesthetic.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Difficulty distinguishing between so 'idealized' style and personal style?	labels:I slipped into the "easy casual lounge wear" early on in the shut down where I live. I almost immediately left crappy and sad. I realized for me, in a world where I have no control over anything, I do have control over what I wear. Even though I have been working from home, and have no where to go, I get dressed...every day.   After a while I realized that, no one sees me except maybe a waist up video call once a day, so why not wear things that I was excited about? Who cares if anyone else likes it. I have always been drawn to vintage pieces and even had a few in my closet. I rarely wore them because they didn't fit the classic business casual that was expected in my office. I wore those pieces almost every day. Then I started a Pinterest board with really specific criteria, earth tones (looks good with my skin tone), vintage cuts, texture, natural fibers. Boom. For the first time in my 30yrs I had a style that I loved!   I kept the few items I already had and loved, and slowly started collecting others that would match or compliment them. I went the thrifting route because 1. its cheaper, and 2. I could find good quality pieces in natural fibers more easily than if I had gone to the mall. I would visit a thrift store once every two weeks and get one or two items, always reminding myself of my criteria (natural fibres, classic/vintage cuts, earth tones). It narrowed down what I looked for and bought which made it easier.  Now, two months later, I have a cute little capsule wardrobe, and I LOVE every piece.  I guess that was a really long winded way to say, wear what you want and what inspires you in the morning. Especially now when no one is around to judge you while you are just "trying things out".	episode_done:True

I'm in my early/mid 20s, and now that I've worked a couple years at the same place, I'm wearing more what I want than boring professional. I also started caring about what I wear and planning my outfits. Velvet shoes, corduroy overalls, rainbow prints, sequins, bold colors. Who cares? I've been called out for dressing "fancy" before, but I've stopped giving a shit in correlation with my confidence in my abilities. I'm a teacher...if anything, I'm showing the students it's okay to be yourself and take risks.

I also pop into thrift shops regularly for 5-10 mins at a time with a strict list. The list doesn't just include clothes, so my successful trips tend to be high. I don't thrift shop online. The one time I took the risk, I regretted it. It's way more expensive and it's risky so I don't bother with it.	episode_done:True

text:I do this too for my nicer pieces but there are some made of certain fabric that gets so stiff and no longer soft if you air dry it.

text:Let's Talk about hats	labels:Don't wear them inside. But that one is pretty spoken. Edit: inside a house. Not like shopping at the mall or as a required element of your job uniform...  Don't buy them too tight - it's tempting to ensure they don't fall off your head but they'll leave red marks on your forehead.  Remember to wear forehead sunscreen if youre wearing a backwards baseball cap or you'll have a very, very strange tan line. Thats not from experience at all...
text:Girl if I go to the trouble to put on a hat and secure it to my head, you better believe I'm keeping that shit on inside.   If you take it off, it ruins the security previously established when you left home, never to be attained again on the go, you inevitably have hat hair, and then you have to carry it or put it somewhere, which is annoying.   Wear your hats inside! No one cares!	labels:Its generally considered very rude to wear a hat inside someones house in my area (and many others) which is why I mentioned it. I wouldnt actually say anything to someone who wore a hat in my house bc thats super awkward and rude lol. Of course this may vary with location and absolutely never applies to religious head coverings.  Fun fact my family friend once scolded Chris Hemsworth for wearing a hat inside her house while picking up his kid, and when he took it off and profusely apologized for his rudeness she just about expired, as she had no idea her son's friend was the kid of THAT Hemsworth lmfao	episode_done:True

text:What I Like is Not What I choose to wear	labels:What I like to look at and what I like to wear are not the same thing. I actually think a lot of fashion struggles come from people not understanding how to separate what they find aesthetically interesting from what meets the specific needs in their life.  When you look at a photo of an outfit, you're not *just* reacting to the outfit itself. You're also reacting to the body of the model, the styling choices (makeup and hair), and the photography decisions (the pose, the location, the lighting).   I might look at a photo and think "that person looks so cool in that outfit," but that person isn't me. I would not look that cool in that outfit because I'm a completely different person.  When I choose clothing for myself it needs to satisfy my aesthetic tastes when paired with my body and the amount of effort I'm willing to put into styling (i.e. zero), as well as suit the needs for my daily life. That's actually a limited number of options for me.   But when I am admiring an outfit or a photo, I'm not constrained by my hang ups about my body or the needs of my daily life. I can just like the outfit without having to contextualize it around myself, which is actually quite nice.  So, personally speaking, my interest in fashion isn't limited to clothing I would choose to wear. I find it's much more freeing to allow myself to enjoy fashion and outfits without always questioning whether I would like the outfit on my own body.
text:Well-said! Body type especially has a big impact on how an outfit/style is perceived. Models showing off androgynous styles rarely have curvy body types. Meanwhile, "sexy" looks often go hand-in-hand with curvy. And the "off-duty model" look pretty much requires already looking like a model, otherwise you're just a chick in casual clothes. A beautiful woman looks good in damn near anything, that's why most models are beautiful women, lol.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:How to build a style with a limited outlet?	labels:Volume (a lot of items) and access (lots of designer things) doesn't create personal style. Personal style creates personal style, and it is a huge spectrum of things. There is no "one up" in personal style when it is authentic and your own. You'd simply appreciate all the style around you as its own, and appreciate and focus on your own style and look. Most people on social media have tacky, pointless style. They're wearing clothing, etc. for likes and clicks. The problem with this is that it means you're always cycling through what generates likes and clicks - not what is unique and stylish about you. You don't need new clothes. You don't need to change. You need to recognize your style and own it, and find the validation in it how it comes versus mirroring/measuring it to someone who is operating for validation and attention.	episode_done:True

Makeup, clothing (including bras, underwear, and socks), accessories, shoes (can replace only worn out athletic shoes), tech including headphones/charging cables (can replace my laptop or phone should they die), books, craft supplies (unless I get a custom Etsy order and need something for it), stationary/office supplies (I can only buy a 2022 planner).

That is irreplaceable and even though I only wear it to special football games I would cry over that jacket more than any other item. Her brown faux fur coat would be next. My "sentimental/valuable" jewelry collection (I'd pawn it if I had to), my black gypsy skirt that looks like moths have eaten the bottom from it snagging on things (it's survived me for 10 years, I ain't giving up on her yet), my made-in-Ireland hand-knit emerald green wool sweater, this ridiculously comfortable yet loud romper that I'm conveniently already wearing, my purple shawl, my lucky Lucky jeans, my space boot Doc Martens and my snow leopard Spirit Hood.  It's a weird list that doesn't seem to go together, but that's what comes to mind first. I've kept these items for years despite all my style changes and wardrobe rehauls. I could (and probably will) replace everything else eventually.  I hope you and your house stays safe - I'm in Cali too, gratefully far enough to not worry about having to evacuate but close enough to watch the ash falling like snow. I'm praying for you.	episode_done:True

text:Wardrobe not updated	labels: I feel like (depending on where you live) we are all stuck in a holding pattern. I would normally buy more "work shirts" at this time of year, but there isn't much point since I'm only on the job site about one day a week (and it's so cold indoors, I'm always bundled up anyway).   I've encountered some similar issues before when I had to switch to work from home a few years ago due to a move. A lot of my new purchases went unworn. If I learned anything from that experience, it was to spend money on clothes that are for the house or for trips outside, not for work. In practice, this meant a lot of yoga pants, but also light summer clothes that were suitable for walking the dog. Most of the work staples just didn't even register. I know it isn't fun, but it's not a bad thing to wait and see what happens in your area.	episode_done:True

text:Shitpost Saturday: Naughty or Nice?	labels:I am on Fashion Santa's **Nice** list this year! Even though I'm home all by myself and the only person who ever sees me is the Amazon delivery guy who I wait for by my window because *oh my god, I need human contact,* I'm still putting on a full face of makeup, doing my hair, and wearing spanx, a push-up bra, a sheath dress that fits like a second skin, 4" heels, and perfume.  I'm doing it for *me*, you know, because feeling sexy while I'm all by myself is much more important than being comfortable. Sure, it's easier to get coffee and cheeto stains out of my bathrobe than a 100% wool dress, but cheetos aren't sexy either.   For Christmas, Fashion Santa is going to bring me a brand new dress for every zoom event I have scheduled in 2021, because I would just die if people saw me wearing the same outfit week after week, which is definitely the kind of thing people are thinking about these days.

text:People with an over the top personal style, how do you incorporate it into your day to day?	labels:As someone who dresses like an absolute nut job I have learned that generally speaking as long as your outfit is overall appropriate for the situation, you can get away with murder. Like I wouldn't wear a sequined micro mini or ballgown to my office job, but I would absolutely wear a velvet suit and a bunch of brooches. I have also noticed that when I wear pieces that I love, my confidence increases throughout the day. Sometimes I have moments in the day where I look down and think "dang, this outfit is cool and I feel cool!" Those moments just give me a boost of confidence all on their own. The last thing is that people are generally too busy with their own lives to notice what you're wearing. They're doing them, so do you and have fun with it!   edit-words
text:Or better yet‚Äî when they do notice you, they feel inspired to do them!!!

text:Are your glasses part of your style?	labels:I typically wear contacts, and glasses when my eyes need a break. As you can surmise, the pandemic means a lot more glasses time. A couple of years ago I thought about how my glasses were much more boring than my outfits. So I started to mix in more fun and colorful frames. It also helped that my eyes have hardly changed over the last few years. So I started getting fun colors. I had a brown pair with neon trim as the first "weird" pair. Then a wood grain, which was the neutral, then a bright blue pair, and later yellow metal frames. Now a pink and black pair is leading....I can't seem to find the yellow! I am not sure what I'll get for this year.   Anyway for me, I realized I needed statement glasses to go with my love of pattern! I still mostly stick to solids and either cat eye or narrow rectangle shapes, but I find attention attracting glasses are a nice exclamation point on an outfit.	episode_done:True

Back when I wore more business clothes, I would have separate at home and work clothes. Changed out of my work clothes as soon as I got home and into sturdier/less expensive outfits.   Also recommend keeping a lint roller in the car.   To generally look polished: add an accessory like a scarf, earrings or a necklace.   I‚Äôm also a fan of tucking shirts/sweaters.

text:If you don't want to invest in a ring light, you can also position your laptop in front of your TV and open Youtube... search for "white screen 10 hours" and up your brightness.

text:How does a warm weather wardrobe differ from a cold weather wardrobe?	labels:Lots of good comments already so I'll just say plan for one additional layer in the summer when you work in a professional AC environment.

text:How to build a style with a limited outlet?	labels:Well, i won't claim to be a style icon but my recipe since i was a teenager is essentially as follows:  1.  Buy used.  I mostly thrift but also look on used slow fashion instagram, Etsy, Poshmark, etc.  For thrifting, there is no secret - just go often, don't feel any pressure to buy something every time you go.   2.  Only buy natural fibres (silk, wool, cotton, linen) - this isn't hard and fast as I have thrifted down puffer jackets, etc but if it is touching my skin it isn't acrylic or polyester.  3.  Buy things that are interesting.  A unique shape or colour, or a beautiful material, it stands out on the rack. I mostly don't thrift fast fashion, it was shit to begin with - I am looking for vintage tags and high quality clothing.  Look at how the seams are finished, how the buttons are sewn on.	episode_done:True

I am wondering what the rule of thumb generally is comparing women's sizes with men's and also specifically for Norse Projects. I am male, 5'8-5'9 and 130 lb. I wear typically size L for sigfred lambswool sweaters for a slightly oversized fit. I wear a L for Vagn crews. I am looking at the Aslaug brushed lambswool in size L and it's a women's sweater.

text:Article: Why Is Fashion So Beige This Season?	labels:The last time I remember noticing beige getting popular was around 2009 (the great recession). I was going to fashion school at the time and one of my profs noted that neutrals tend to come in style when the economy tanks because the pieces are more versatile. Like, there's only so many ways you can wear a bright pink top, but you can generally wear neutrals with everything.  Anyhow, I've noticed color palettes are trending more neutral again and I took it as a sign that fashion folks are taking into account that during the pandemic customers are trying to stretch their buys as far as possible.  Tbh, I don't feel strongly about it except that what I think it signifies makes me sad. I think it's triggering some minor trauma from my early adulthood and the recession ü§£

I love how most of the robes and things seem very interesting, but also lived in and functional. Everyone just wears whatever they want or whatever suits their lifestyle, and no one else pays it much mind. Dude walking around in shiny battle armor?

Just because something isn't currently on trend, does not mean it can't be stylish.
text:I never got on the mom jeans bandwagon to me they seemed both uncomfortable (no stretch) and unflattering. If a cut of jean even looked unflattering on the runway models probably not a good sign for the rest of us.	labels:Personally I find mom jeans way more comfortable than even stretchy skinny jeans.

text:What are some differences between stereotypical Millennial and Gen Z fashion/aesthetics?	labels:I associate Gen Z fashion with crop tops and sweatpants, so yeah it makes sense that people in their 30's buying expensive ethical clothes aren't going for the sporty spice look.
text:Totally.  To me, Gen Z is a lot of clothing that isn‚Äôt work appropriate but super fun. A lot of crop tops, bra tops, spaghetti straps, usually some tummy showing, and then some baggy pants. Lots of thrifting and also cheap fast fashion. Doc Martens and other platform shoes. Very 90s/early 2000s. Long acrylic nails, false lashes. Really fun and can be a really ‚Äúhot but trashy‚Äù style   Millennial fashion is more professional/better quality/structured. Linens, trousers, heels, sandals, etc. Frankly I think it has to do with millennials having more money. Low key hair, nails and makeup. Neutral colours and patterns. It‚Äôs a more mature style   I‚Äôm 25 so I get to do both üòé woohoo	labels:I'm 27 and on TikTok and I feel like lightly dragging Millennials is sort of in-joke at this point, even if for the most part we're on the same side and they know it.

text:I want to eliminate the need for dry cleaning my work wardrobe. Sadly, anything nice seems incompatible with machine wash. What long lasting, work pieces have been easiest for you to maintain?	labels:I wear a lot of stuff from Rickis, RW&Co, and INC International Concepts. It's all fairly inexpensive, holds up well, and is machine washable.  "Dry clean only" is almost always a lie though. Clothing manufacturers are required to put care instructions on garments, dry clean only is an easy way for them to avoid responsibility if the garment gets fucked up while being cleaned.   Almost everything with a dry clean only label can be put in the washing machine in a mesh bag. If something seems really delicate (sequins, glitter, delicate mesh) then you can almost certainly hand wash it. Just avoid heat and you should be fine. At this point the only things I would dry clean would be items with sculptural/3d elements that would break down if they got wet.  I thrift most of my clothing, so I'm really daring about putting things in the wash, because if it gets wrecked I'm probably not losing more than $10. I've put dozens of dry clean only items in the washing machine and I don't remember the last time I wrecked something by doing so.	episode_done:True

Then as time goes by, the categories that come up over and over are the most important to grab first and would improve the most outfits. I add them to a list  If I'm shopping and I want something but it's not on my list then I try to pass on buying it. When a deal pops up and it's something on my list it's a no brainer instant purchase.   I try to be patient and wait for items that meet all my picky criteria. If I'm not in love with it I don't buy it. If even one thing is not right, I pass.   And final thing is I aim high whenever I buy for these categories in quality and spend time hunting. Ex: If I have $250 for a jacket I try and wait till a $600 jacket goes on sale for $250. You can find investment worthy designer for near regular retail prices and it's worth the extra money.	episode_done:True
text:The RealReal Alleges Chanel is Maintaining a ‚ÄúMonopoly‚Äù With the Help of Big-Name Retailers, Publishers in New Filing	labels:> Chanel became concerned that its classic flap handbag was being carried by too many people ‚Äòwithout style'  LMAOOO this is this is elitist pete level of gatekeeping.
text:Also imagine dunking on yourself that hard  "People without style like our products" is another read of their statement, basically.	labels:It's not saying that, but, it isn't too far removed. My takeaway is more that "our products aren't desirable enough on their own to maintain secondhand/resale value, we have to artificially increase demand to synthesize an air of exclusivity".   It's really not unqiue to Chanel as a luxury/elite product producer, but they are more notable than other designers in the (silly) lengths they go to protect their brand image. That said, I'm not a lawyer, and I kinda doubt they are a monopoly, so I guess we'll have to see	episode_done:True
text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - January 17, 2021	labels:Does anyone have any recommended brands for muscle fit dress shirts? I.e, a dress shirt usually with a cotton and spandex/elastane blend (usually around 97:3) so it is not too tight at the chest/shoulders and no baggage at the waist, where I taper. I have found a polyester/spandex blend but not a higher quality cotton one. Only managed to find one very obscure Italian brand that doesn‚Äôt ship to North America. Thanks!	episode_done:True
text:Throwback Thursday: Revisiting "How to Determine Your Body Type" and "On Dressing Your Body Type"	labels:So, I'll start. I definitely fell into the trap of both not really understanding my own body and trying to look like a tall slim hourglass all the time (which is not my body.)   Taking the time to really understand silhouettes and how to adjust them for my body was a huge breakthrough for me, as well as readjusting my thought process toward "what do I want to emphasize?" vs "Is this flattering?"   Being more thoughtful and critical about the difference between something looking good and something emphasizing the "tall slim hourglass" was also really helpful. So much of fashion that we feel is objective is actually about our eye and what we train our eye to perceive as good. Getting away from that, and training my eye to see the tall slim hourglass as one silhouette among many, really helped me wear things "I couldn't pull off."	episode_done:True

text:‚ÄúI'm all locked down with nowhere to go ‚Äì but that hasn't killed my lust for fashion‚Äù	labels:I have one suggestion, get dressed and take pictures. It doesn't have to be for Instagram/facebook. It can be for just yourself. If you really like an outfit, remember it with a picture. You can take it in a park, or at a location that is memorable for you, with your SO, or with your cat. You should at least get a few good pictures with you pet in the 10+ years they reside with you.  It's actually a fun learning experience, on how to use the cameras. I am interested in photography and usually use a dslr, but for selfies, dslrs are not as good. With an iphone, I think it's an entirely different genre of photography. You have to use completely different lighting system, etc., to use it to its full potential.

It made me look at things in a more runway mindset, "Why is this outfit interesting?"  I have a request, if you're taking requests (no pressure though, this was great)  a summer album?

Hopeful-me will think about buying a teal floral wrap dress because it‚Äôs gorgeous. Realistic-me knows it will sit in my closet untouched for 3 years because I don‚Äôt wear teal!

text:What do you carry in your handbag?	labels:Depends on what the day is like for me.  I have the Madewell Medium Leather Transport Tote currently as my daily go-to and I normally have my phone, keys, wallet, some basic toiletries (chapstick, eye drops, ibuprofen, candies in case blood sugar gets low) in a small zipped bag, and more often than I'd like there are some random receipts and other things that should be cleared out.  When I'm traveling, all the extra space in the bag is used for things like carrying a light cardigan, small water bottle, headphones, small notebook, and other necessities for the day. It's been great for it's versatility.  I've thought about the idea of getting a higher end purse, (I think the Neverfull Tote from LV looks nice) but I honestly can't seem to confidently justify spending 10x more on basically the same thing (large tote bag) I currently have. Would like to hear more on why people buy luxury items and their experiences!
text:To answer the justification question - cost per wear. My own NF is going on 12 years old now and still looks reasonably new, and I am not (and have not been) particularly kind with it either. I've tossed it around, dragged it on planes, beaches, through Asian wet markets etc. and it's still happily trucking along. The LV Canvas is notoriously hard-wearing.  Along the same line, quality of material used to construct the item. I currently also own leather bags from Everlane and Away. They're both well made, but you can tell the leather is substantially lower in quality, thickness and overall substance than say, my mother's Prada totes with leather that feels really thick and luxurious and plush. And with the Everlane bag, the unfinished suede interior is much rougher than the unfinished suede interiors of say, Celine bags and the leather is much, much thinner.  And while not all designer bags will age well, there is a reason Hermes bags can be handed down through generations but my Everlane bag will probably die before I do.     ETA: LV aside, the aftercare services are also generally pretty amazing. There are brands that will take your bag back and "spa" them for free or nominal fees. You don't get that kind of service with Madewell or Everlane.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE!- October 20	labels:Can anyone recommend a good brand of tank top to use as an undershirt that meets the following criteria?  - Long enough to be tucked into the pants without coming untucked throughout the day by doing things like raising my arms, bending over, etc  - Armholes and necklines aren't massive on larger sizes.   The few brands I've tried, I had to go for larger sizes to meet first criteria, but then I ended up with tanks with armholes and necklines so massive that it looked like one of those goofy wrestling leotards. It looked stupid, and it was also very uncomfortable because I often had the hems rubbing on my nipples. Ideally, the neckline should be low enough that I could wear a v-neck without it being visible, but not so low that it sits below my nipple line. And the armholes shouldn't go lower than a few inches below my armpits. And again, needs to be long enough that I can tuck it into my pants without it coming untucked (I'm 6ft and 220lbs, so I do have a bit of a gut).

text:Purses: Real vs. Faux Leather?	labels:For me, (retired, age 75) real leather bags are not an investment I would make now.

My current favorite bag is ‚Äúpleather‚Äù cost $15.00 new, and has good zippered pockets. It actually looks decent and definitely classier than the price would suggest. The chief advantage of this bag is that it‚Äôs durable and waterproof when set down in rain or snow. One drawback of both real leather and faux leather bags is they‚Äôre heavy.  A wonderful alternative to both real and vegan leather is nylon, such as Baggalini or Haiku brands.  Light weight, practical sizing, fun colors and quality construction.

text:I think KW's cardigans are decent for the cost but in comparison, they don't mention the ply of the fabric and I think that's notable since a well-made 4-ply sweater is going to last longer and (I think) be more resilient to pilling. I'd guess that KW's are a 2-ply though either way, I noticed that the weight of their medium shawl cardigans is nearly twice of what OP says the W&C is. I'm assuming this is also a difference in the yarn being used (with merino generally being lighter/thinner if I recall).	labels:I did a little search and most "british wool" is around 2/9 - so yeah, almost twice as heavy as the merino yarn.

Would like to support small business. However, I‚Äôm in the US.   1) first, Is anyone familiar with a good place to buy them? I was looking at Aran Sweater Market and they seemed reasonably well priced at around $100 USD. I know you can go all the way up to $700 for a super fancy one but that‚Äôs not really an option for my budget. I could probably go as high $200 if it‚Äôs something I know will be worth it.   2) Any recommendations on the fit? When buying most shirts I have a problem with getting the right size with a shorter body (about 5-8) and a larger chest. I‚Äôd say for a normal shirt I‚Äôm right at about the lower end of large, can usually get away with a medium if I don‚Äôt eat a lot of salt.

text:What was your "how in the name of all that is holy did this end up in a thrift store" find?	labels:It‚Äôs less about the value of the item and more about the stars aligning perfectly.  I wear a size 12-13W shoe, plus other things that make my feet really hard to fit, so I am used to buying formalwear to match the one maybe two pairs of formal shoes I own at any given time.  So when I was 17 and going to prom in 2006, my mom tried really hard to help me find shoes, any shoes, that were suitable. But we could only find casual flats or runners, and I realllly wanted to dress up nicely for the first real time in my life. So she said ‚Äúyou know what, let‚Äôs buy a dress and then we will just have to find a way.‚Äù  So I picked out a black and pale pink dress that just made me swoon, and I figured black heels would be easiest to find. Lol I was so young and stupid.  Anyway we searched high and low right up until the week of prom, we drove to the US from Canada and looked there and I still couldn‚Äôt find a pair of heels that fit enough to buy and I decided I‚Äôd just wear uncomfy like always and deal with it.   Then I randomly walked into a thrift store and saw on the shoe rack a pair of pink heels in the exact shade of pink on my dress, with black trim. Picked them up, size 12W. They fit like they were made for me.   Wore them until they broke three years ago.
text:Okay this isn't a thrifting tip, but my feet are similar, and I've got a heel finding tip for you: Drag  With how big drag has become in the last few years there are a lot of online shops that cater to Queens who have a hard time finding shoes that are big and wide enough.

The next year, I was invited to a nonprofit fundraiser with a friend and threw this on last minute (I changed in my office bathroom) for this fundraiser.

text:For those who actually MISS clothes/makeup/getting dressed up.	labels:I miss getting dressed a lot. I don‚Äôt really have lounge clothes, just exercise, so I was really struggling with clothing at the beginning of this.   Additionally, I just graduated my masters program, and my job during the school year essentially had a uniform, so I was really excited about graduating and starting a new job to get dressed again. And then here we are.   I also miss getting dressed for occasions. I already had my graduation outfits picked out, and had three weddings this summers that I was looking forward to wearing dresses to. Going to the grocery store is now the only time I can put on clothing and I‚Äôm just really sad. I know there‚Äôs a lot of people who are like ‚Äújust wear your clothing in your house!‚Äù Which yes, I can definitely do that. But part of the joy of getting dressed for me was the ‚Äúgoing somewhere‚Äù part. Picking out my outfit felt like I was putting on a costume to play a part for the day, which I loved. I know I am so so fortunate that I can safely work from home; but I really miss my ‚Äúcharacters‚Äù. Wedding guest, or fancy date night, or professional worker in winter. All those roles have been reduced to WFH and grocery shopper now and I‚Äôm just really sad about it.	episode_done:True
text:What are your fiction and or nonfiction plans and outfits? What are the things you want to wear just to wear?	labels:My husband and I are planning "fancy" dinner on Christmas Eve. I have a couple party dresses that I would love to wear, as well as a cute Christmas fascinator that I have been wearing for Zoom calls, and he has the easy option of a tuxedo.   It is our first Christmas in a new home, and our first Christmas not traveling in something like 20 years, so while we will miss seeing friends and family, we are looking forward to just being together and doing the stuff we like to do.   Also I bought three pairs of fleece-lined holiday leggings for $2.99 each at the hardware store a few weeks ago. They probably won't last past New Year's, but they are cozy and festive, and they go with my wardrobe of flannels, sweatshirts, and wool socks, so I am enjoying them.	episode_done:True
text:Can we discuss how uncomfortable it can be to dress fashionably sometimes? Must beauty = pain? Looking for comfort tips!	labels:I think that‚Äôs one of the reasons why I gravitate towards more grunge/street wear style. Comfort is a big deal to me and I can‚Äôt stand high heels, they make me feel unsafe like I‚Äôm on stilts. A nice pair of work boots or sneakers just feels right. I got married in a pair of shiny Dr Martens with a tea length dress to show them off because I love the look so much!	episode_done:True

text:I need help with getting rid of clothes	labels:I very recently purged my wardrobe majorly. I ended up getting rid of lots of items that I loved in college, but they simply don‚Äôt suit me any longer as I‚Äôm finishing law school and beginning a professional career.   I kept asking myself, as I went through piece by piece, ‚Äúdoes this have a place in my future? When I envision myself as I wish to be perceived, does this article of clothing suit that version of myself?‚Äù I don‚Äôt mean it to sound super deep lol but that helped me a lot as I navigated trying to nail down a personal style.   I got rid of SO much, and I feel great. My closet looks so nice and less cramped and chaotic. I have been slowly incorporating some versatile basics, but before I make any new purchase I make myself think out three to five different ways I could style the piece with what I already have on hand. I‚Äôm also trying to make a point to cut out most acrylic and purchase higher quality fabrics that will (hopefully) last for many years.	episode_done:True

text:How to find non-custom tailored clothing for short men (under 5')	labels:This is a huge issue I haven't been able to solve as a short man who isn't skinny and has large hips. Boy's clothes are just too small, even in "hefty" sizes. Hefty sizes that are big enough are often too long regardless. Also, while it's possible to find pants for short men, jackets are impossible to find. Suit jackets, yes. But anything more casual, no.	episode_done:True

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - January 05, 2021	labels:For a peacoat, I have 3 options  1.	WW2 era vintage. Decent condition, not amazing (as expected for something not old). ~$50. From seller measurements the sleeves may be 1/2-1 inch short but it‚Äôs close enough to where it‚Äôs within the margin of error 2.	J Crew Dock w/ Thinsulate, new. $120. 3.	Kenneth Cole 100% wool, new. $110  I put the prices on here but I‚Äôm not concerned with paying an extra 60-70 bucks as this is something I plan on using for years.  All should fit me based on the measurements, but no returns on the vintage, the other two can be returned.  Which one will feel the best/be highest quality?  Thanks
text:I have a major dislike of outerwear if it's too short in the arms or body. On a cold or rainy day it defeats the entire point.

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - January 12, 2021	labels:What shoe brand do you know that have Vans' style and around the same price range but is significantly more comfortable?  I used to have Vans and they looked great, especially with jeans and cuffed pants but after getting Adidas boost I couldn't go back to Vans...Boost is just way too comfortable, been rocking them for 3+ years. However I like the look of Vans + pants so I've been shopping around recently. I tried a few pairs of Vans today but their comfort can't compare with Boost.  Are there any shoe brands that have the Vans style but is way more comfortable? There might even be comfier Vans models that I didn't try. Any recommendations are greatly appreciated!

text:What are your thoughts on outfit repeating multiple days in a row?	labels:So I did this for a week once as a social experiment.  I was sick of putting together new outfits everyday and was curious if people would notice. I wore the same blouse, blazer and pants for an entire work week (yes I washed them). I don‚Äôt remember if I changed my necklace or shoes at all. Hair and makeup are always the same for work so that wasn‚Äôt a factor.  Nobody commented or seemed to notice throughout the week. On Friday afternoon I asked people if they had noticed anything about my appearance and they said no, and when I told them about my experiment they seemed genuinely surprised!  The biggest surprise for ME was how bored I quickly became. I basically felt like a cartoon character and was excited to wear my other clothes again.  So no, I don‚Äôt think it matters, but if you plan on doing this long-term I would recommend buying multiples of the same item to eliminate excessive laundry.	episode_done:True
text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - January 19, 2021	labels:Hi - working from home these days in New England, I'm looking for a recommendation for a pair of winter shoes (i.e., water resistant and warm) that I can slip on without using my hands for simple errands like taking out the trash, dropping the kids off at school, etc. I've tried a couple LL Bean options but each required to use my hands, which can be difficult when I'm also carrying trash, kids, etc. I typically don't wear socks at home, and so if there was an internal lining that's even better. Looking to spend under $150. Extra points if it reasonably goes with athleisure but not a requirement.  Thanks!

text:How many pairs of jeans and pairs of shoes should you own?	labels:Women can have things they enjoy having without being concern trolled about how much they really need it.   I don't see men getting hassled for the amount of electronic waste their hobbies produce.   I doubt every fifth post in the Funko Pop subreddit is about curbing consumption and how they should be rethinking their involvement in a plastics based interest.   Personally, I think they're wasteful as shit, but I'm not about to roll up into their space and shame them for it.  I'm so over the handwringing, guilt, and joylessness about fashion in this sub sometimes.
text:I was SO surprised when I came to this sub and thread comment after thread focused on purging, and capsule wardrobes, and minimalism. As some one who regularly keeps articles of clothing for 7+ years by caring for it well I just Do Not Relate and also do not want to!	labels:On the point about caring for clothing, I do NOT understand when people post about clothing disintegrating in the wash. Like. How is that even happening?!
text:They're either incapable of understanding the basics of doing laundry that even a teenager can manage or they're lying, girl.   Any excuse to distance themselves from the poors and justify overpriced clothes because paying over $100 on a shirt means it's "better quality" than the $20 all the poors can afford. It's not.  They're just treating their cheap clothes like shit because they're cheap. The name brand stuff gets handwashed with angel tears by virgins with long hair in sundresses. Then they're surprised pikachu when the H&M sweater pills and the Sezane one does not.   Or even better, the h&m sweater is *obviously* shit because it pilled, but when your sweater is $300, pilling is suddenly "inevitable" and just use an electric shaver.	labels:Someone asked how to avoid sweaters disintegrating in the wash, so i asked what they meant, and they meant literally just pilling.  So I guess you're spitting truth lol
text:I once saw someone here say that "falling apart in the wash" to them meant pilling, fading, and exhibiting basic signs of wear.

It's cute, but it doesn't match anything that I've worn this summer lol. Maybe that will get better this fall if I can get some more plaid clothing.	episode_done:True

text:Pros and cons of an a capsule wardrobe?	labels:Disclaimer-- I know myself well enough to know that a capsule wardrobe is not for me.  When I get back from traveling, I cannot wait to wear different clothes.  Consider your laundry situation.  Having a smaller wardrobe means that you will be doing laundry more often.  If you're one in a family of 6, it may not be a big deal.  But for a single apartment dweller (pay per load), the additional costs can add up quickly.   Because I pay per load, I make sure that I maximize the capacity and only wash full loads (I'm paying the same no matter the capacity).  I am not one to hand-wash clothes in a bathroom sink.  Not now, not ever!   I do laundry roughly every other week alternating lights and darks.  (Sheets and towels are their own ballgame, and I will sometimes throw things in with them.)
text:Just curious but why didn't you get a washing machine for the apartment?	labels:Some condos either don't have space or they don't have the right connections. I do wonder if some rental apartments mandate coin laundry.
text:It's weird to control what appliances go into places you rent out in my opinion.  I only want to know what conditions lead to her not owning one because it is common where I'm from even in the cheapest type... People are so overly sensitive here they downvote anything that has the slightest possibility of being offensive	labels:Washer and dryers aren‚Äôt so common in a lot of rentals in Canada- not sure about the States. There are communal paid spaces in a lot of rental buildings. Condos and houses usually have them though and if you are renting a place with your own washer and dryer you are paying a premium and it can be a difference of a couple hundred dollars more a month in rent.
text:Is it actually that ridiculous? Granted I'm in a major Canadian city so rent is rather ridiculous anyways.	labels:I am too. I am in Ottawa and that is just the reality. A lot of apartments are older buildings and would need to be completely retrofitted to accommodate individual washers and dryers in each unit.	episode_done:True

text:Is Y2K fashion coming back organically or is it a result of progressing the 90's comeback to the next decade since that trend seemed to work out?	labels:Everything eventually comes back in fashion.  Personally I would love for 2000s jeans to come back - not super low rise or the ones that were bedazzled or laced up but just normal rise bootcut and flare jeans. I have a few from that era that I still wear all the time and a couple more that I had to replace with similar ones from poshmark because I couldn't find them in shops.  I also miss 2000s makeup. Sure, there was too much body glitter and candy colors but there was also the fresh dewy look of blush and a light lip gloss - think Britney Spears in her Oops I Did It Again video, or Mandy Moore's makeup in her video for Candy. Not everything in the 2000s was horrible lol.

text:People who built your wardrobe consciously from scratch - what were your strategies?	labels:I'm a fashion graduate and have worked in fashion in some way since college, I found while I tended to make my own clothing or shop in thrift stores I was still hoarding clothing constantly (mainly with a "oh that fabric might come in handy even if I don't wear that!").   I moved to the UK from the States and realised my South Coast wardrobe wouldn't really work in London. I brought a few staples such as dungarees and jeans that fit like a glove with me and then just rebuilt when I moved.   I tend to ask myself   * Will I wear this in five years time?  * Is this well made? * Does it match at least three other things I own? * Does it make me feel good?   I found that I stayed away from things that were just a 'good deal' and fads. I don't have a Pinterest but I definitely know that I prefer earth tones and tend to stick to those :)	episode_done:True

text:Any advice for overcoming self consciousness/self doubt when you're trying to step out of your comfort zone and expand your style?	labels:I typically just start by wearing them to places like the grocery store first. By my logic, there have been several times where I have worn a cocktail dress and heels there just to pick something up and have not given myself a second thought about doing so, so why should a bright shoe, or another item of clothing I am self conscious about be any different? Likewise, I have also seen many people at the grocery store in some cool items, and will not be thinking about it for more than 5 seconds.   After that if I still wasn‚Äôt completely confident I would probably try to wear it to a small gathering with family or close friends.   I also just try to keep in mind that nobody cares about what I am wearing as much as I do. Honestly, most people are too obsessed with thinking about themselves and if others are noticing their insecurities to spend more than a few seconds, if that, on a stranger. As long as you like your item, be confident in it and others will notice your confidence much more than the item.	episode_done:True
text:Google Launches Price Insights for Online Shopping. Track Prices for All Your Clothes.	labels:Hmm. I did a google shopping search for a pair of Mizunos and found the ones I wanted for $30 cheaper than most retailers. I ordered it from a place called runners inn. Well it took 2 months to get here and there customer service was terrible. And when I tracked it, it was coming from the Netherlands. I kept contacting them in chat and I would always be like 70th in queue!  It was awful. When I looked them up there BBB rating was something awful. I guess I should‚Äôve researched the company first and just stick to reputable sites. I had another order in the same time frame coming from Lithuania and it got to me in 3 days. Another site though.
text:Yeah, I've ran into them a couple of times - they consistently have the best prices for a wide range of products, and also appear to have the largest stock available - sizes you can't find anywhere else are listed as "in stock". They have lots of webshops - runner inn, but also dive inn, outlet inn, kid inn, tech inn and so on, and all of those webshops have some of the worst customer feedback I've ever seen.

text:How do you shop at TJ Maxx/Marshall‚Äôs?	labels:Short of getting a bit of insider info, I think the only way to really have success at those stores is to browse them at least once a week (probably twice).

She says it doesn‚Äôt take her long because she‚Äôs so familiar with their stock, but it still seems exhausting to me.  (As opposed to spending three hours scrolling through Poshmark in bed every night‚Ä¶)
text:Definitely agree with this. I consider it my "quiet time" when I'm combing through a store like TJ Maxx or even a thrift store. It's not a hobby for people in a hurry. I enjoy the hunt almost as much as I enjoy the find!	labels:I used to. But last time I was browsing Marshall's, I was followed by a security guy.

Because honestly I can‚Äôt imagine what Thom Browne leisure collection would look like if he did try to jump on that trend! More sweaters?  I‚Äôm very much not the target customer (relaxed Bay Area and all that) but looking though the website really gives me the idea that I could be that kind of immaculately tailored prep school person. Really speaks to how strong the overall image is within the brand.  I also didn‚Äôt realize about Billy Porter‚Äôs Oscars gown. I really wanted to like it, but the proportions seemed kinda weird.

And no, I don‚Äôt think the white shoes thing is a rule anymore.  I kind of regret mine though, even though it was a super deal so I wouldn‚Äôt be losing much money, it‚Äôs harder to keep clean than white sneakers and for some reason (maybe the shoe shape or how I walk) keeps picking up black and grey marks.

text:Can we talk sleepwear?	labels:I was very into this idea as well and invested in some Lunya PJs...but that elegant person I invisioned didn't magically appear. I still had a big messy bun, acne patches on my face and slept with my mouth wiiide open. I didn't feel as comfortable in those PJs and that fantasy I had didn't come true, ya know? I don't want to discourage you, just my two cents as someone who had a very similar thought process  I went back to tank tops and sweatpants and I find I appreciate them a lot more now. I make sure they fit properly and don't have stains or holes so I still feel reasonably put together.
text:THIS. I have been working on a lot of \~self improvement\~ this year and part of making my goals for 2021 has been distinguishing "the person I aspire to be" from "the person I am willing to be" from "the person I can afford to be."   I too have been on a journey to live a budget life of luxury especially when it comes to things like matching lingerie all the time and sleepwear and what I've realized is that I'm not actually interested in luxurious sleepwear. I'm actually interested in being the person that has two hours to unwind every night, takes a warm bath in a massive tub with a v expensive lush bath bomb, does a full face care routine, brushes her hair out, has little tinctures on her vanity to apply just a bit of perfume, puts on a silk gown, lights a candle, reads in bed, and turns out her lamp at a generous 9:30pm.   The truth is that the desire for the sleepwear is really a desire to have more silence, more time spent on me, and more time doing things that look and feel good simply because I like them and not because they serve any kind of real function.   I have moved away from using old t-shirts because I like the idea of dedicated sleepwear but I usually just go with a solid color cami / tank top / shirt and either some shorts or some sweat pants depending on how cold it is. They're cheaper but still look thoughtful.	labels:I think we may be the same person!	episode_done:True
text:Do you think that designer brands will no longer be as sought after in the future?	labels:Someone has to buy the designer firsthand for the secondhand market to have its inventory (and the brand itself to have cachet). If anything, secondhand is providing a bridge for younger, less affluent consumers to buy into a brand and eventually become direct customers.

text:Does anyone have a "uniform"?	labels:I often buy multiples of items I love. I bought several of the same cardigan after I realized that I wore it more than any other sweater I owned. It's great!  Another thing I do is, when I see an item I like, I mentally run through my closet and see if it will mesh with what I already own. If it works, I get it. If I'd have to buy several new items to make it work, I don't. For this reason, I don't own many t-shirts, but I do own lots of sweaters and dresses.
text:That‚Äôs the biggest life lesson I‚Äôve carried on from one of my high school teachers - if you find you truly love an item of clothing, it‚Äôs worth the time to go back and get it in every color (that‚Äôll fit your wardrobe).   Now if only I were the type to recognize immediately that I love an item instead of waiting until it‚Äôs no longer sold, that‚Äôd be grand.	labels:I also suffer majorly from non-buyer remorse, but just had a major win recently! If I love something but I'm either not able to afford it or just not ready to pull the trigger, I take a photo of myself in the item, a photo of the store tag, and a photo of the tags on the clothing (especially any tag with a style number). I spent 3 years looking for a specific out of my budget Paige denim jacket that I tried on at Nordstrom Rack by scouring ebay, etsy, poshmark, etc.   Last month I finally found the exact jacket (confirmed by the style number and tag information) on Poshmark in excellent shape for a great price. Unfortunately in those 3 years I've gained a bit more weight than I realized and it's a bit tighter than my original try on photos, but still wearable!
text:Oh hell yes. Happy for you!  It‚Äôs a good idea to take pics of tags, I haven‚Äôt thought of that. That would make second-hand searches so much easier.  Y‚Äôall convinced me. I‚Äôll start searching for another one of a dress that a snap is broken on ü§û	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Shopping for clothing items you already own: confessions of an outfit repeater	labels:Little black dresses for me. Sometimes I look at my closet and think, "I should really get more color in there," but the fact is, I feel happiest and most myself in neutrals. Past couple years I've been trying more colorful clothes. They do get compliments and objectively I like them, but what are my workhorses? The neutrals. Mainly knee-length black dresses. And a single red bodycon dress that's made its way into the regular rotation.  So now I'm trying to look for clothing with interesting texture, silhouettes, and architectural details, but color is no longer a requirement. I make up for it by having a colorful home.	episode_done:True
text:If you could get yourself one fashion gift, what would it be?	labels:I'd get a really nice piece of outerwear, either a coat in a quality material like wool or a leather or shearling jacket. If you live somewhere with colder weather during part of the year, outerwear is something you'll be wearing all the time so it's worth investing in a piece that's great quality, keeps you warm and makes a statement. I think an amazing jacket or coat will elevate even the most basic outfit, whether it's a more classic piece, something utilitarian like a puffer jacket or something more extravagant. Personally I think Acne, Chloe and Tibi are brands that make great high-end outerwear in a variety of styles.
text:OMG yes if you just moved to the Midwest you need some outerwear. I am from Wisconsin. It gets cold as fuck here	labels:I didn't just move here but I'm also never prepared for winter here.

text:Have you ever gotten tons of compliments on something but are still on the fence?	labels:I‚Äôd agree that personal comfort is the big thing.    I‚Äôd also pay attention to the content of the compliment. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a cool sweater‚Äù is NOT the same thing as ‚Äúyou look great in that sweater‚Äù, KWIM?   Sometimes people are appreciating the design or color or novelty of an item and not the big picture of how it works for you.
text:It's a lot weirder for someone, regardless of interest, sex, gender, etc. relative to the recipient of the compliment, to say "you look great in x" rather than "x is cool." The less potential implications behind a statement like that, the less it has room to be misinterpreted.	labels:Exactly. I may like an article of clothing, but I‚Äôd never say I like how they look in it. Instead I tell them I love their dress, shoes, pants, etc.	episode_done:True
text:Dae get overwhelmed by fashion?	labels:I actually find most people are in the same boat as you, so I wouldn't worry too much.  It does take a lot of time and effort and money to keep up with fashion.  It helps to think of it as a hobby; and people who are really put together generally go about it with the zeal of, say, a stamp collector and stamps.  Just like how some people are basketball enthusiasts and others are gardening enthusiasts, there's really no reason you have to be into fashion.  I find that there's this really pervasive expectation that women all ought to naturally love clothes and fashion; and any failure to invest in that interest is a failure in some biological sensibility.     If you find yourself struggling, then I really do recommend getting a stylist or tailor or ideally both.  The stylist will push you to try things outside your comfort, the tailor will help you with fit issues, and having both can really be transformative in a very quick and immediate way.  But in terms of continuing your education or interest--that really depends on whether you want to make this a bit of a hobby.  It does take time and effort and money, after all.  And if you don't naturally find yourself interested; well, there's no sense in forcing yourself just in the name of "fitting in" to some perceived societal norm.       I assure you, from Paris to Shanghai, there are plenty of women who would rather learn the nuances of cement than spend any time pondering the fit of a pair of trousers; and there's nothing wrong with that.	episode_done:True

text:How would you store sentimental clothing?	labels:I have a fabric storage box that I got from Michaels (probably readily available at any craft/fabric store). The only issue is its kind of odd shaped so finding storage wasn't as easy as just sticking it on a shelf (according to at lrast some sites...when long-term storing clothes, its.better to have fewer folds, so the box is kind of long and skinny? I am not a fabric expert so I'm not sure how true that is).   For random sentimental pieces, I did things like make pillows. I wanted to be reminded of them, but I didn't need it to stay clothing, if that makes sense!	episode_done:True

text:What are some of your least favourite brands?	labels:I wouldn't say I inherently hate the brand but I think Champion is an example of a brand that exploded a few years back/to now basically all because some celebrities or whoever wore it- and everyone who wears it now is most likely a ding dong hypebeast type or the VSCO type girl or whatever. Like I'm old enough to remember it being bottom tier Wal Mart level shit you'd get borderline made fun of for wearing- but now all of the sudden it's enjoying this moment. So it's just that perceived inauthenticity and collective pivot in peoples' minds to a fashion name to people rather than just athletic apparel that irks me somehow.  However though, the Todd Snyder Champion stuff is PHENOMENAL- it's not the mainline stuff. You don't see any of those assholes rocking that.

text:Does anyone else have ‚Äúirony pieces‚Äù?	labels:A long time ago, a friend at work told me no one would take me seriously as long as I wore cheapo pantyhose.  I looked down at my crappy nylons and actually felt cheap. I went to Nordtroms that night and bought presentable nylons and wore them to work the next day. She nodded in approvement and then told me no one would take me seriously as long as I wore cheap sweaters. I then bought a wildly pretty ivory cable knit sweater and wore it to work and feeling quite exactly like 1000000 bucks AND i had fancy nylons too. She told me no one would take me seriously with my unkempt shoes and that's when I learned the power of a shoe shining kit.  The next day I wore crappy slacks...and, well you know how the story goes.  To this very day I wear natty clothes and shoes so shiney they can blind fleet of Greek warriors.  The only real irony is no one gave a tootie about nylons and yet I still wear them despite all evidence to the contrary....and she threw al hers away after our company got bought out by another and they were no longer required.

People around the office were gossiping that I was trying to find a man. "No, a man is looking for HER!", she told them.   Then suddenly she disappeared. Quit over the phone and changed her number. I like to think she was an angel in a very impressionable time for me, but I think she might have just had issues with her work visa.	labels:I can also claim an impeccably dressed Ukrainian woman as my fashion muse.

text:Do you think fashion or style has age restrictions?	labels:I'm mid-30s and I still wear that stuff on weekends! There is definitely stuff I avoid, but honestly, reflecting on it right now, that might be more my personal style at play than my age. I avoid anything too tight or clubby, and I  tend to go for block heels or pumps over stilettos or platforms. There was a whole going-out-top-nice-jeans trend in the 2000s that makes me avoid anything satin- or lace-based. But I think that Vans/Converse or crop tops/high-waisted jeans are definitely still in play if you're 30. And if that changes soon, I'd guess it's because the trends change rather than what is appropriate age-wise!
text:The 'going out' top! I just realised why I've avoided fancy tops from that era, I think I was firmly over the impracticality of them.   I wonder how soon halters and/or one long sleeve tops will be back?	labels:I've already been seeing one sleeve tops around a bit lately.

text:Teach me how to successfully shop secondhand please!! Or just commiserate if it‚Äôs hard for you too lol.	labels:A few tips that work for me in thrift stores: - I pick one section and don't feel like i have to check out the entire store.  - I go through racks and touch everything and stop when I touch something that feels like a nice fabric - silk, cashmere, good wool, crisp cotton. This helps me get to the nice stuff when the racks are visually overwhelming. - try on lots of things! Sometimes you fall in love with stuff you didn't expect to.   On websites that are searchable: - have a very specific item in mind or a specific brand you like - narrow the search results by size, brand, color, and fabric - pay attention to the measurements to see if things will fit - don't be afraid to make low offers on sites where you can do that  I find online thrifting very different than in-store thrifting, because online, you can search for all kinds of specific things, where in a store, most of the fun comes from finding something unexpected.
text:> I go through racks and touch everything and stop when I touch something that feels like a nice fabric - silk, cashmere, good wool, crisp cotton.  If anyone is curious, this is a trainable skill. Go to a thrift store. Just go down a rack and touch every garment in the rack. Make a guess in your mind about what fabric it is, and then check the actual material label. If you do this over and over again, your guesses will become more accurate until you can accurately predict what the material labels will say. It's a skill that can be systematically practiced.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Craig Green Spring 2021 Menswear Collection	labels:Call me crazy, but Craig Green has never done anything for me.  Sure, stuff like 1, 4, 6, 11 looks good, but is ultimately fairly ordinary (and I just don't think making stuff padded is all that innovative).  Fashion-as-art-onto-itself stuff like 10, 17, 22 also looks good (and I guess it earns him his avantgarde cred), but doesn't filter down to the stores.  So there is this gap between fairly ordinary stuff and out-there artworks that he can't seem to fill. But in that gap lives the stuff I'd like to wear.
text:The tension between the ordinary stuff and the artwork is part of the appeal for the fans. That moment of realization that this weird otherworldly look is made out of like chore coats and jeans and shit like that is the part of the fun.  Craig is explicitly more interested in making cool runway moments than the clothes being cool on the rack, so I that's a legit criticism.	labels:Yeah, I get that.

I cannot overstate how taxing it was to not see the scale budge downward for so long and always seemingly ticking up. a suit I had bought a year prior to fit comfortably after I gained weight was starting to not fit, real "ah shit here we go again" moment. at the start of the pandemic though, i lost 14 lbs in like two months and was ecstatic. i ticked another 10 or so lbs downward before I plateaued and you know, I was happy about it because I never felt hungry and I had a consistent lifestyle and it was good that I could live like that and not gain or lose weight at all. Then, I came down with food poisoning in december and barely ate for like a week and lost another 10 lbs (hardly healthy but in 2020 i'll take the good with the bad). Even after getting better and feeling good again I have kept that weight off and now weigh under 200 lbs for the first time in years. I'm ecstatic for more progress in 2021 and hopefully finally being confident enough to buy the dope clothes I want and not worrying that I look bad in them.  It's so interesting what relativity does to you. I'm 198 lbs rn, but I was last that weight when I was a senior heading off to college and felt awful about it. Now, I feel fucking great and way more confident than I was before. Funny things. The mission is 170 lbs but I'll be happy to be between that and 180. Sorry for the paragraphs but I know this forum more than almost anywhere will understand struggles like this, especially for guys.

Now, I feel fucking great and way more confident than I was before. Funny things.   I've been losing weight for the last year; weight I've carried with me for far too long now.  When I have started to plateau (normally because I'm eating too many calories or not exercising enough), I weigh myself and tell myself that I will either be really happy or really sad to see myself at my present weight again, and it's my choice to decide which it will be.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Coveteur: An Ode to the Striped Shirt	labels:I have...entirely too many striped shirts.   I am a sucker for them. I was always told to wear vertical stripes because it would make me look slim. Growing up, I was a beanpole. no boobs, no hips, just enormous feet. So I started dabbling in horizontal stripes to make me look a little less scrawny.   then in my 20's I got my boobs done. those horizontal stripes now made the new boobs look absolutely vulgar and *I loved it*. I still do.  wide horizontal stripes are great for toning them down, thinner horizontal stripes really bring out the wow factor. I have a few tops that are a little baggier, with stripes, and I find that those are the perfect way to wear a casual tee while still being like LOOK SHE HAS A SHAPE!	episode_done:True
text:Does your language affect how you wear colors?	labels:I don‚Äôt understand how this translates to fashion really. Just because you don‚Äôt have the word to distinguish a color, does not mean you cannot visually appreciate the difference or incorporate it into your outfits?  Most men I know have a very limited color vocabulary - pretty much the basic colors of the rainbow (and honestly you may get some blank stares if you say ‚Äúindigo‚Äù and ‚Äúviolet‚Äù outside of the rainbow context instead of ‚Äúblue‚Äù and ‚Äúpurple.‚Äù) But my husband can see colors and visually distinguish between my coral top and my blush blouse even though both he would describe as ‚Äúpink.‚Äù He even owns shirts that incorporate salmon pink and lavender and turquoise although he has no idea what they are called. I also doubt that he knows his sports gear feature ‚Äúchartreuse‚Äù and ‚Äúteal.‚Äù His clothing color limitations are more gender-limited than word-limited.	episode_done:True

text:>crocs   Lol if you compare it with crocs I would definetly not get it...I am just trying to understand as to why people think it's not fashionable or dorky/nerdy? I am not saying it is or isn't, but I definetly don't want to come as this scinecy/bookwarm/fashionista type  and tbh I am not that bothered from sun, like I hate it sure, but never had a sunglass and never really complained, so technically I can buy prescription sunglasses, just want to know as to why so many people think it's nerdy/dorky exaclty	labels:Weird, I‚Äôve also found them weird most of my life. I can‚Äôt quite describe why I think they‚Äôre dorky but I will say that most people I see wearing transitions just aren‚Äôt very fashionable people. To stereotype a bit, these people mostly fall under the dorky/nerdy types and tend to be older people as well.  Of course, it could simply be that people who like transition glasses tend to be less concerned about appearances and value functionality more. If you‚Äôre confident about your overall look, I don‚Äôt think transition glasses would look bad at all.   Now if you‚Äôre a so-so or horrible dresser, transition glasses become more of an eye sore.	episode_done:True

text:NYT: Jil Sander is back, with a new Uniqlo collaboration and a lot of opinions.	labels:Here in Canada all the sizes were pretty much cleared out online by 8AM EST.   I did however, make it to my local Uniqlo and managed to grab some of the pieces I couldn't get online.  &#x200B;  * White Light Down Volume Hooded Coat: Really nice and a lot thicker / more durable than I expected it to be. I have a black Veilance Down jacket which gets a ton of mileage so I'm not sure where this "fits" in my wardrobe.  * Black Merino Cardigan with the Cloud: Surprisingly love this. Looked a little strange / quirky online but actually has a nice drape, interesting hem and a nice contrast patch at the bottom of the buttons.  * Black Oversized Ribbed Blouson: Love the details on this piece (especially the sleeve ribbing). Definitely looks more expensive than your average Uniqlo piece. I got an M and it feels potentially a little TOO oversized. I have a Green S on the way as well so at least will be able to compare.  * Navy Double Faced Work Jacket: Looked boring online but I put it on and loved it. The fit is on point and the drape is amazing. Definitely on the expensive side as it is only 70% wool, but it's like a a nice modern & minimalistic work jacket which can be a little hard to find.	episode_done:True
text:PSA: Revive by Rent the Runway via Thredup	labels:Okay I‚Äôve used an purchase from RTR for a while now. 99% of the clothes I get are great quality and very clean. I agree that from ThredUp, the clothes seem more worn and not as trendy. Nothing I‚Äôve gotten from RTR rented or otherwise has looked as worn as some of the ThredUp stuff. Mind you RTR is designer and not so much fast fashion options. I currently have a Temperley London dress from RTR that retails at $1195. Most of their items retail for minimum $150, average around $250. So if ThredUp is getting higher quality pieces, then it might be worth the look.	episode_done:True

text:Overdressing - Discussion	labels:Since quarantine I‚Äôve been WFH and not going out socially. So, the grocery store now gets my best looks and I really hope Kathy at the register enjoys my new booties as much as I enjoy wearing them for once!  In general, it‚Äôs better to be overdressed than underdressed. I don‚Äôt normally show off my fits at the grocery store, but desperate times call for desperate measures!

But to my shame, after 5 weeks inside and 9 more predicted to come (UK) I am mostly thinking about  what I am going to wear. I AM GOING OUT! Fake fur, big red shoes, velvet, leopard and sequins are firm candidates. BUT I doubt I will follow through because I am afraid it will show a degree of carelessness and disrespect to hospital workers and patients. So it will be comfy and neutral, but it‚Äôs fine because I AM GOING OUT!	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Good quality men's jeans?	labels:I've had one pair of jeans tear in the crotch in my entire adult life (it was a silly pair of Burberrys I had been gifted). I always wonder what people do that they get crotch tears so often. Rarely washing jeans also seems kind of meme-ified? They're just clothing; wash when necessary!   As someone who also favors slim-skinny jeans, chinos, etc., Rag & Bone is my absolute favorite "everyday" denim. The denim comes, or at least used to come, in different weights with a nice amount of stretch. Good range of colors as well. Fit 1 verges on being too skinny, but Fit 2 is perfect. R&B is always a bit overpriced at retail, but pretty easy to find on sale.   Saint Laurent during Slimane's tenure put out the sleekest, cleanest jeans and I love the pairs I have from that time, but I have no idea what the current offerings are like. I try to wear them a bit less frequently.	episode_done:True
text:Does anyone invest in real jewelry?	labels:I didn‚Äôt really start buying fine jewelry until my mid thirties and even then I don‚Äôt buy too much of it because it can get pretty expensive and while I love jewelry, I don‚Äôt have justification for buying it most of the time. üò¨üòÖ I think the only real fine jewelry I bought for myself was some diamond stud earrings and engraved gold rings. Most of the fine jewelry I own is actually passed down or gifted to me. All my eclectic pieces I own are more along the lines of fashion/costume jewelry and purchases by myself for casual wear.  As for vendors I like, here are a few names I follow: Ochre Objects, Vrai, Caysie van Bebber (really expensive and I don‚Äôt own anything from her; I just like looking at her work, haha), Liesel Love, Aurora Designs, and Social Value (this one is great for affordable diamond jewelry).  For nice, eclectic pieces, I like Local Eclectic.  For old estate pieces, I follow ChelseagirlNYC, Zacharysjewelry, and Ivy & Rose.  Lastly I do like to look at Blue Nile. Sometimes they have good deals!

text:BoF: J. Crew's New CEO has a Survival Plan: Edit out the Ugly	labels:i just feel like their price points are so high and the quality can be kind of mediocre. they‚Äôre stuck in a weird place where their pricing is too expensive for the average consumer who‚Äôs trained to expect bargains and too cheap for someone who buys luxury or higher end pieces.   even with their random extra 50% off sales, it‚Äôs still above what people expect to pay. but then again, madewell is thriving. (though i think that has more to do with being able to capture an on-trend aesthetic.)
text:I'm a J. Crew loyalist, so I'm acknowledging my potential bias but I'm also a fan of Banana Republic and went through a hardcore BR phase. However, I've kind of forsaken Banana (my young professional wardrobe was full of it) and returned to even more J. Crew -- I've found that, in general, my pieces from J. Crew last longer and hold their shape/quality more than what I have bought from Banana. Also those 50% sales are usually goldmines for me! Just my experience!	labels:I loooove BR - they‚Äôre in my price range and their clothes just fit me well - but quality is absolutely hit or miss. I have stuff I‚Äôve had for years, and I also have a dress that I wore twice and then a ribbon on the back just fell off haha. But for my budget, if I‚Äôm picky, I do very well there. (Love J Crew for linen pants and shorts, though!)
text:The crazy variations in quality seem to be there across the whole BR brand family. I have some things from Gap that have held up for literal decades, while others started looking like crap after a few washes. Then there's Old Navy which is mostly very low quality (though probably about on par with the price point for most of their stuff), but occasionally something of theirs will last forever.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Why I‚Äôve tracked every single piece of clothing I‚Äôve worn for three years	labels:Who in the fuck needs 55 undershirts at one time?! I feel like I'm bordering on excessive at only 10.
text:Author here. This is a very valid point. That IS excessive, even on my scale. I have way too many now that I had to stock up when the good ones became available.  I don't want to try to explain away this, but I might add some minor points to add nuance.  Part of this inventory is at my summer house (most Finns have a summer house to go hide in), so this inflates inventory. I also need whites and blacks to with my button down shirts at work. The tanks also have a different use case.  At least they don't go out of fashion or anything. It will take a good while for me to get back down to a more sensible level, but they will all be used.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:How many pairs of jeans and pairs of shoes should you own?	labels:I think it's interesting that you hone in on "needs" when for many people fashion fills a hybrid function of both hobby and utility. Both shoes and purses seem prone to being "collector's items" moreso than other garments (leggings, sweaters, etc.) and it makes sense to me as a fashion hobbyist and collector that people would have more than they "need" or use regularly. Also, as people age they typically gain more buying power, space to store things, and access to various occasions (business events, formal events, lifestyle changes that may necessitate a wider variety of things to fulfill a wider variety of functions).   Furthermore, I haven't found this sub's focus on "purging"/closet cleaning reflected in real life--while people do obviously consign or donate old clothing, it's pretty common for people to keep things or simply put things in storage as their use wanes. So on that note, it seems unsurprising that people have a handful of things that see constant rotation and a handful of things that are rarely used but are still enjoyed, so there is no reason to get rid of them.
text:Fwiw I know at least two men who own a ton of shoes and hats. As in 50+ pairs and a store rack worth of hats. One of them collects sneakers as a hobby while the other just likes his shoes and hats to match every outfit. I would guess it's similar for women who own a lot of purses.   I personally don't like purses at all so I only have one for when I absolutely have to (dress codes at fancy events, weddings etc). With "nice" shoes it's hard to find any that are remotely comfortable, so I see a lot of women buying various pairs of torture devices in hope of finding the perfect ones, only to end up with a ton of impractical footwear that never gets worn. I myself own 3 pairs of ballet flats that give me blisters and I haven't got rid of yet. But then if I'm invited somewhere I won't have any nice shoes and idk if I should keep the toe blisters ones or the heel blisters ones or the ones that fall off my foot every other step.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:How do you shop in COVID?	labels:I did a complete wardrobe overhaul and at first was going to buy my items from regular online shopping like at J Crew and Banana Republic, but then I realized I could find those same items secondhand through Depop. I usually find online shopping to be a pain, but being able to search for specific essentials I need for my wardrobe and also scroll through and find unique vintage pieces made the process really entertaining. It turned out that I enjoyed this way more than regular shopping in stores!   The way I tackled it was I searched for specific items I needed that were essential to me (e.g. black velvet square neck top) and did my best to avoid fast fashion items that I knew weren't built to last. If I needed help visualizing a piece, I asked for a try-on pic, measurements of the bust/waist/hip/length to make sure it fit my body the way I wanted it to, and material content. It's nice too that I'm supporting a small business and oftentimes messaged with whoever I was buying for a bit to ask questions about the item and maybe haggle a bit, that social aspect was nice. Essentially 90% of my closet is secondhand from depop now after shopping over the course of a couple months and I love that I'm in love with every piece that I have and was able to curate each one to suit my needs.  It definitely takes some patience and a good eye for pieces/what materials are best, but I think that's far better than how I originally used to shop and has taught me a lot about how I'm allowed to be picky and absolutely love and enjoy my items, instead of buying things just because it's on sale even though I'm only lukewarm about it. You can find some really good deals and unique vintage pieces while saving money and saving clothing from landfills!	episode_done:True

text:If you don't get recommendations, and if you haven't already tried, try filtering by location+handmade when searching in etsy.   When you do find a shop you like, try browsing their shop owner's favorites. I've used that method to find new etsy sellers that I like.	labels:Thanks! Thats a good idea, appreciate it.   Love your fits btw :)	episode_done:True

text:/u/redditqueen88 Additionally, if this comment applies and you are feeling generally apathetic with more fatigue than usual and you do not have a history of depression, you may be vitamin D or vitamin B deficient. This can be the case if you're getting less sun than usual. These deficiencies can manifest as mild depressive like symptoms and can be addressed with over the counter vitamin pills (or naked sunbathing if you're into that).	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Shitpost Saturday: Beauty is Pain	labels:Okay, so there are these totally beautiful shoes. Like they are absolutely to die for. The biggest problem I have is that they don‚Äôt fit me. They are just the tiniest bit too small for me. My mom‚Äôs solution was actually really simple. Just cut off a part of your feet! Long story short, I did that but the guy I am interested in, totally saw that and is now completely grossed out and it also kinda ruined the shoes. So now I cant stand on my feet without being in agony and I am single. On the upside I can now fit in my stepsisters‚Äô shoes.

text:What are some of your least favourite brands?	labels:I wouldn't say I inherently hate the brand but I think Champion is an example of a brand that exploded a few years back/to now basically all because some celebrities or whoever wore it- and everyone who wears it now is most likely a ding dong hypebeast type or the VSCO type girl or whatever. Like I'm old enough to remember it being bottom tier Wal Mart level shit you'd get borderline made fun of for wearing- but now all of the sudden it's enjoying this moment. So it's just that perceived inauthenticity and collective pivot in peoples' minds to a fashion name to people rather than just athletic apparel that irks me somehow.  However though, the Todd Snyder Champion stuff is PHENOMENAL- it's not the mainline stuff. You don't see any of those assholes rocking that.

text:You don‚Äôt know me.	labels:Well for $140 you could buy 6, $20 white hoodies and $20 worth of dye and have 5 attempts to figure it out...

text:Oh I get it, yes, you are correct!	labels:	episode_done:True
text:how often do you wash your clothes?	labels:it depends on the item of clothing? like I do laundry weekly, but I wash things separately. sheets and towels etc are washed with an unscented soap in one load, certain clothes are hand washed and line dried, some clothes are run in a cold cycle, some clothes are worn multiple times before washing. so it varies widely but laundry every 1-2 weeks makes sense for me when I‚Äôm only doing my own laundry
text:I'm with you on the unscented detergent bit. They put WAY too much fragrances in them and they all make me gag.  I do a lot of hand washing, too. Many years ago, I ran out of Woolite and had to use shampoo...it works great. It gets hair clean, so it is a cinch to get clothes clean without an offensive amount of fragrance. I all my bras/lingerie tops and pantyhose/tights this way and they turn out pretty nice. I love making my clothes smell like Dove soap. :D	labels:	episode_done:True

text:What are "iconic" items that you should know about, and their basic history? What items can singularly be identified as "starting a trend"?	labels:New Balance 990 was the first mass marketed ‚Äúluxury sneaker.‚Äù Notably, it was produced in an understated gray colorway, contrasting with the bright neons that dominated the athletic shoe market at the time. It was also the first sneaker to retail for more than $100 and, though now associated with unfashionable comfort-conscious dads or Japanese-inflected americana (depending on which circles you run in), was coveted, especially among sneakerheads.	episode_done:True
text:How to avoid looking older with your clothing??	labels:I looove this aesthetic, it's my actual workwear, and funnily enough I dress this way because it does make me look older.  To stay age appropriate, the key is accessories. Socks that fit the aesthetic but are more playful, bows are great, and fun jewelry. There are so many looks, like plaid skirts, that I like but would never wear because they're better for a younger look. Also, if you don't already look older than your age it's probably not going to be a problem. If it does have that effect, it's not in an inappropriate way so it really doesn't matter.	episode_done:True

text:It‚Äôs 2021. A vaccine for the virus has been made widely available and businesses may operate at full capacity, including bars, clubs, salons, etc. How will this influence fashion?	labels:Fashion is going to be bling bling style again. Just loud and sparkly to make up for the sadness of this year. Those horrible velour tracksuits will be back, hopefully not in pastel colours because deeper colours will be more modern.   Same goes for makeup. Unlike the ashy pastel makeup from the bling bling era, I'm thinking deeper shades and shimmers, multichromes for eyeshadows. Glossy lips too since masks are gone and liquid lipsticks have been around for a long time, but with colours not clear like old times.	episode_done:True

text:Fashion "fantasies" coming true years later?	labels:Male here (kind of important for this story).  Growing up I was always really jealous of female fashion, makeup and the ability to express yourself in your clothing (and it not coming down purely to details or fabric). I dabbled in the japanese rock scene back in HS, partly because I really liked the music, partly because it opened up a lot of opportunities for exploration. I didn't have the guts to go all the way though, but did some light makeup and had sort-of feminine haircuts.  Anyway, past HS this was all behind me, except in my art where I kept my aesthetic alive, though never consciously setting out to do so. I've since moved the canvas onto myself, so haven't picked up the pen much at all lately.   Fast forward 10 years or so, and I'm standing at a graduation ceremony. I work as a teacher, and I'm saying goodbye to my students, since summer break is about to come up. All teachers are lined up, and I look at my female colleagues and feel a real sting of jealousy. I'm standing there dressed in a shirt and pants while they're wearing lovely dresses, with earrings, makeup and bags.  I decided enough was enough, and went and bought nail polish the same day, and booked a time to pierce both my ears the day after. This all coincided with a long solo trip to Japan, where I bought a ton of makeup and really started to let lose. I also started (slowly) incorporating female cuts and items into my wardrobe, but every step needed quite a bit of courage, heck they still do. My comfort zone has blown wide open but anything beyond what I wear regularly gives some slight anxiety.  Then in 2020 I started posting here, getting feedback and help, and through constant cheering from colleagues, friends and students I finally feel like anxiety isn't keeping me away from expressing myself the way I want.  &#x200B;  So yeah, kind of a tangent, but that's my fashion fantasy coming true.

text:Alexander Wang accused of a history of sexual harassment - fashion in a year of reckoning?	labels:I thought this was old news but it seems to have been buried enough that it's just getting widespread attention now. I learned about it when the video of him dancing to WAP came out. I used to think that certain industries were rife for this sort of thing, but after a career change from arts to STEM I've realized they're all as bad as each other, albeit each with their own twist.   That said - I think fashion and other arts industries (looking at you, publishing) suffer from the issue of having just enough white women and white gay male representation to pat themselves on the back with the energy of a perpetual motion machine and drown out any and all criticism about diversity and representation, regardless of how genuine it may be. And when white people are concentrated at the top of the power hierarchy, it makes intersectional issues that much harder to surface with clarity.   For every person who has been harassed by AW, how many powerful white industry gatekeepers have brushed it off because they think only straight white men can be harassers? (And, of course, when a straight white man turns out to be an abuser they still can't accept it because "he's one of the good ones" or "he just made a mistake one time, it's not fair to ruin his life").  This only starts to get fixed when the industry gives equal respect and attention to the voices of everyone who helps to create it - whether they are a celebrated designer, fashion editor, personal assistant, early career model - anyone. I have plenty of reservations about social media, but the democratizing effect of reaching a huge audience without being beholden to the industry gatekeepers has been a very good thing for issues like these.	episode_done:True

text:Shinies From the Past - or, What to do with Gifts from Past Relationships?	labels:My first (meaningful) boyfriend gave me a diamond necklace when i was 18. It was lovely, I wore it constantly, and received many compliments. And then we broke up, as one does with their teen boyfriend, and blah blah blah, after a while I was like, "wtf do I do with this?"  I was *never* going to wear it again and selling it felt a little mercenary.   I ended up giving it as a gift to a girl I babysat/nannied for when she turned 18. It was nice because it was a way for me to give it to someone I cared about and I was able to give her a much nicer gift than I normally would have. And now when I think about that particular piece of jewelry, I don't think about my imploded relationship with my ex, but my relationship that I had with this girl as she grew up.
text:That's a beautiful way to pass on a gift like that! I think if I had that kind of mentor/caretaker relationship with someone I would love to do something similar. Good on you!	labels:	episode_done:True
text:How much was your most expensive fashion item and when or how often do you wear it?	labels:My most expensive items are my Native American Turquoise jewelry and my cowboy boots. Just purchased a huge $900 squash blossom necklace and have worn it constantly. My boots range from $30 for a secondhand pair to $750 for custom made and none are worn more or less than the others.  When my mother passed, she was 88. I went to clean out her closet and drawers and found so many lovely things that were carefully boxed away or wrapped in tissue that she was ‚Äúsaving for good‚Äù. Ironically, ‚Äúgood‚Äù apparently never came as these things went unused.  I decided right then to never do that. Every day is special and I am worth taking the time to look and feel special even if I‚Äôm just out running errands.
text:I really love the southwestern, Native American traditional styles and bohemian, cowgirl styles. I grew up/live nowhere near the southwest USA and don't have that particular lifestyle, but I'm trying to incorporate into my personal style nonetheless. I am starting to build a collection of silver and turquoise jewelry. It's nice to hear that you appreciate your turquoise jewelry too!	labels:I‚Äôve loved that vibe since I was in college and I‚Äôm older now so the draw of that style has never gone away, just become more refined over the years. My wardrobe is awesome now, having been curated over several decades, and I look forward to wearing it right to the end.‚ö∞Ô∏è	episode_done:True
text:Thoughts on Shein?	labels:Controversial opinion, but, they aren‚Äôt that bad.   Let‚Äôs have some empathy for a moment: it is an absolute privilege to be able to shop at a sustainable store and/or to be able to buy secondhand. Imagine being someone who hasn‚Äôt bought new to them clothing in years because they can‚Äôt afford to and then fast fashion prices are waved in their faces on clothing that fits them and is their style. I‚Äôm not going to tell someone to not buy clothing from a place they can afford. I‚Äôm absolutely not doing it.   People demonize fast fashion because they look at it as black and white and don‚Äôt understand that, if you‚Äôre shopping at SHEIN, you likely can‚Äôt afford the more sustainable sources/you can‚Äôt find what you‚Äôre looking for secondhand. I‚Äôm plus sized. I can‚Äôt fit into and afford a lot of the sustainable brands out there. And, people buy out the ‚Äúfashionable‚Äù plus size items in my local thrift stores to sell on Depop, so, I don‚Äôt blame people for shopping on SHEIN.  I‚Äôve bought SHEIN secondhand and I‚Äôve had items for years and I haven‚Äôt had any issues. I haven‚Äôt bought first hand from them in a long time but when I did, I never had any long shipping times or anything, either. I found the same defects I‚Äôd find at Target, like, a long thread here or there that I can easily snip off.   This goes for fast fashion in general‚Äîif you take care of your clothes and wear the appropriate size, you can make them last. It‚Äôs not like they spontaneously rip apart, you have to do something to make them do that. Steam your clothes to get out wrinkle. Tumble dry, hand wash, etc.
text:You raise good points, but I‚Äôm going to respectfully disagree - I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs ever any valid excuse to buy from a company who openly profits from exploitative third world labour. We can all do better.   Sustainable fashion is expensive, yes. But *usually* buying quality clothing is cheaper in the long run than buying lots of cheap stuff (I know this is easier said than done for people living hand to mouth).   Secondly there are options that don‚Äôt exploit people. Namely second hand shops and Depop. I guarantee - no matter what the item is - someone‚Äôs already bought it or something VERY similar and wants to get rid of it. Even when I have money I buy from there because... why wouldn‚Äôt you?   The ‚Äúwhat about poor people‚Äù argument always gets made but it just doesn‚Äôt sit right with me. What about the people who are being paid 40p a day in sweltering and unsafe Bangladeshi factories? Factories that are dumping toxic dyes into water sources? We all have a responsibility not to perpetuate the monolithic success of these horrible fast fashion conglomerates.	labels:Absolutely agree u/librarygirl. Second hand/preloved/‚Äòvintage‚Äô, whatever it goes by atm, is cheaper than new, better quality and ethical.   I have definitely been through periods where I‚Äôm calculating every penny and in those times I have bought ‚Äòfast fashion‚Äô. And it‚Äôs always been terrible quality/fit, made me feel self conscious that it looks ‚Äòcheap‚Äô and I always wished I‚Äôd mended or styled up something I already had rather than wasted my money.   It‚Äôs part of a bigger problem though, and I would not blame anyone for doing the same.	episode_done:True

text:Yeah, I will be posting on insta, maybe Facebook (land of in-laws) depending on how sexy the Edie Britt (Desperate Housewives) and Shane McCutchen outfits turn out. I added the social media part moreso so people could try for themselves, because I do keep my social media private. However, I really do think you need to have some kind of goal other than "I'm going to try and dress like Blair Waldorf" to make it fun and keep momentum going.   I suppose I could post outfits here with my face blurred if anything comes together particularly well! However, because I'm not buying any new clothes, not all of the references are as spot on as they could be. As such, I'm nervous people would be disappointed!	labels:No, the not buying new clothes makes it so much more interesting! Buying the cloth is something everyone could have done. I totally get keeping socials private, but would be very exited to see the blurred edition here.
text:It is very fun! I think to myself, "what would this character do with my closet?" so even though I don't have the low-rise jeans and tight satin tops of the 2000s needed to make more exact replicas, I still have a sense of what colors, fabrics, and silhouettes the character would go for. I am also fairly curvy, with prominent dark curly hair, so have to make adjustments there as well. For example, most of what Gabrielle Solis (Desperate Housewives) wears looks much less "classy" on a curvier frame, so to get her "vibe" I have to pick different pieces to fit my body type.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Books on Fashion	labels:A little esoteric, but *Subculture: The Meaning of Style* by Dick Hebdige is an amazing piece of writing on how clothing and style is a form of resistance. You might be able to find a PDF of it online, it's fairly short but definitely worth looking at.   Nora Waugh's *The Cut of Women's Clothes* is more of a historical costume reference book, but the first hand accounts from women's letters and journals about clothing is so universal it makes my heart sing. Also an excellent survey of how the fashion industry and construction methods changed over time.   *Women's Work: The First 20,000 Years* by Barber. While not fashion specifically, it is a *incredible* deep dive into how clothing was first "invented" and how integral women were and are to the creation of thread, fabric, and clothes. It is remarkably well written and a part of history that was completely new to me. I was unable to put it down, so good.   *Fashion-ology: An Introduction to Fashion Studies* by Yuniya Kawamura is heady, but worth it. It's a sociological look at how fashion works as a mindset, industry, and construct. It hits a lot of the themes that pop up in this sub, including the moral and technological debates that occupy a lot of 21st C thought.	episode_done:True

Top it off with a flat brim, snap-back hat and ridiculous sunglasses, typically with one of those straps you‚Äôd wear to not lose your shades while fishing.  The end result is somewhere between 80s high school movie bad guy in the gym glass scene and a dad who‚Äôs about to mow the lawn.

text:Are there any actual fashion trends in 2020?	labels:we must be living on different planets.   lingerie as camisoles, fur trim everything, distressed tops, denim skirts, sweater vests, low rise pants, straight leg replacing skinny jeans, patchwork jeans, patterned tights, flared leggings, corset tops, fur lined boots, super tall platform shoes, juicy tracksuits, animal prints, tie dye, hand and leg warmers, fluffy bags, all were super popular trends last year. this has been the most trend heavy year in my memory, I could barely keep up.
text:I haven‚Äôt seen 90% of any of this.... except patchwork jeans. My god but they were everywhere. Personally I hate them. this was not my year.

text:Has anyone else ever tried on a designer item just to see what the hype is about?	labels:I don't think I've ever tried anything extra expensive on just for the hell of it, but just feeling the fabric on a piece of clothing is so revealing. There's cashmere and then there's the *softest* cashmere imaginable. There are coats, but then there are well-constructed, high quality coats. Of course there are occasional duds, but for the most part there's a clear difference in every detail - not just the label.  As for durability, I think there you might run into some differences depending on what's currently trending.	episode_done:True

text:Ever been censored at work because of what you wear?	labels:What kids wear isn't really relevant, it's what other teachers wear. I likely wouldn't be allowed to wear a feminist shirt to my work if someone complained even though 99% of my coworkers agree. It is inherently politically - that's the point of it!   I would get them to write down explicitly how they define political. Allowing vague rules allows them to apply it unevenly as it suits them, so get them to **write** it out. Plus, once it's in writing, you have evidence to give to your union rep if they try to hassle you over something not outside of their guidelines.  When I worked at a restaurant with older customers,, I got an upper ear piercing, so I had to wear my hair in a super weird low ponytail that covered the tops of my ears because non-lobe piercings weren't allowed.   I live in a liberal area and though political speech/expression isn't allowed at work because we're government employees, solidarity with marginalized people that doesn't specify a political issue wouldn't be considered polticial. our union literally handed out buttons in solidarity with George Floyd to wear on our work lanyards, and PRIDE/ally stuff is handed our by an employee resource group. As long as it's not saying "defund the police" or "keep gay marriage legal!" or something, then that's not politicial thats at most a social issue	episode_done:True

So, they push you to a level wherein you have to do the exploitation in order to survive," he said. >  > The owner, who used to supply a major UK brand not mentioned in this story, described some factory audit processes as a "sham". >  > "The factory is aware when the auditors are coming, so they keep everything in perfect condition before," he said.

text:How do you think access and privilege affect your taste and sense of style?	labels:I grew up in poverty in Kansas. We hardly ever had a house of our own let alone nice clothes. Everything was handed down or good will and I stopped asking for nice things to fit in in school quite early because it was flat out never possible. Even after I moved out on my own and had a decent paying job I always wanted to buy nice clothes, but could never bring myself to spend the money. It‚Äôs just how my brain was wired. Nice clothes were a luxury and if I spent the money on something a bit more expensive I just threw away money that could be used for bills or gas or the inevitable emergency that would deplete what little savings I did have. All of my clothes throughout my 20s were fast fashion or thrifted.   I am 32 and I am in a much better position financially than I ever have been. Couple that with my very fashionable fianc√© and moving to California and my wardrobe has done a complete 180. He‚Äôs helped me realize how bad fast fashion is and now I spend more time finding clothes that actually speak to me. My style has broadened exponentially. I don‚Äôt feel stuck in a particular style (used to be strictly grunge) and I have adopted a more sophisticated style as well. I change up my style day to day based on how I feel and it just feels really good to be able to do that. It‚Äôs a slow process but I‚Äôm very happy with how my wardrobe is improving.	episode_done:True

I'm going to e-thrift them, but since I can't be there in person, I want to know where I should aim at. I know that Eton and everything else in that price bracket is good, but I'm talking about more common brands, easier to source.

text:Fashion "fantasies" coming true years later?	labels:There are items that I fell in love with when I was a teenager/student, but could never afford. Now that I‚Äôm an adult and making decent money I‚Äôve actually purchased a few of these items second hand on Vestiaire Collective or Vinted. The top two are an Alexander McQueen silk skull print scarf and a Mulberry Alexa bag. Certainly not the trendiest of items nowadays but I am thrilled with them and younger me is so happy I finally own them after all these years of wanting them.

text:Anyone else feeling incredibly disconnected from the 'fashion world'?	labels:I feel the opposite, right feel like almost every ‚Äúoutfit‚Äù I see influencers in nowadays is just jeans and t-shirt. If they weren‚Äôt hot and young, the same outfit would get dragged. Like mom jeans and a giant tucked t-shirt that looks like it came from Walmart and we‚Äôre raving about Bella Hadid‚Äôs style. I find it very hard to find fashion influences for adult women that aren‚Äôt super basic, skewed super young, or just generic preppy ‚Äúput a blazer over it!‚Äù J-crew style. The only place I see any creativity at all is in super high end fashion, but that‚Äôs not within the reach of most of us. The whole fashion industry in general is skewed so young, it‚Äôs like after 30 they think I should just wear a sack. The only reason the super high end brands cater to an older demographic at all is that older wealthy women are the only ones that buy their clothes. Any price point below that is plain plain basic city

text:Ordered from Shoe The Bear (rant, experience in post)	labels:Sorry, this isn't directly helpful, but I've ordered from Shoe The Bear two or three times. The first time I kept the boots (suede chelseas) and they were uncomfortable and never broke in, but did very soon expand to way outside the size of my feet despite following their guidelines and ordering what was eventually 2 sizes below my normal size (having ordered multiples to test) leaving my feet to flop about at the heel and yet rub on my toes to the point of leaving red and slightly blistered skin.  Each time after that I've sent them back, based both on sizing and the appearance of quality. I would never buy them at the full prices they charge based on the workmanship and materials they use, and even on sale, they are quite sneaky about how returns work - they put it out loudly that they include a return label, but you have to dig to note that that return label is then deducted from the cost of your refund, and it's not cheap.   The last time I did this, I couldn't use the return label at the post office, even though the website said I could, so I paid for my own postage. When they did refund me, not only had they still tried to charge me for usage of the label, but they appeared to have applied it twice. I contacted the customer support to query this, at which point they asked me if I had used the return label, which A) they should really know at that point, and B) wouldn't have explained the extra charge anyway. They said they would refund it and I should see it in my account sometime that week (it was on a Monday). Guess what? No refund - I had to contact them *again* the following Wednesday to remind them, and only then were the accounts department finally moved to action.   Good deal on sale or not, I would never order from Shoe The Bear again.
text:Their customer service SUCKS.  They're not even responding to my last e-mail of asking why they're accusing me of treating the leather myself and if they're going to anything to assist me considering I'm a repeat buyer. I sent them the e-mail within minutes of recieving the package and do not even have any knowledge on treating leather.  Thanks for sharing your story.  Hopefully potential buyers see my post and yours when searchinf for Shoe The Bear on Google.

text:Thank all of you	labels:So a number of people are telling you not to buy a bunch of AE shoes because they are ‚Äúentry-level‚Äù and that you may eventually want to move up in price. This is true, but consider that anyone saying this has become a hobbyist who appreciates and collects high-end footwear, and therefore retroactively views AE as a gateway drug that led them to discover a new hobby. This implies a linear progression from spending $350 on shoes ‚Äî an amount 98% of men would find insane ‚Äî to eventually spending $1000+ on shoes, which is completely bonkers to all but a very small number of people.  Definitely wait a bit and avoid buying a dozen pairs of AEs too quickly. But also consider that if AE makes you happy and your goal is to amass a rotation of multiple good-quality shoes in different styles and colors, it‚Äôa perfectly acceptable to avoid leveling up. You don‚Äôt *have* to keep buying progressively more expensive stuff, and can instead enjoy what‚Äôs in a price tier you‚Äôre comfortable with.
text:>You don‚Äôt have to keep buying progressively more expensive stuff, and can instead enjoy what‚Äôs in a price tier you‚Äôre comfortable with.  This is one of the most level headed responses on the page and something that resonates with me. Basically all of my shoes are in the $300-$450 USD range and while I like having quality shoes and want to talk about GYW shoes and raw denim and stuff, it just is unfathomable for me to spend US$500+ on shoes at this time. Maybe when I'm making $200k a year I can think about spending that kinda money on shoes but it just doesn't make sense to me.  And, truly, if you're buying even a pair of AEs. If you don't wear them like a tool box, you will have them for years to come anyway.  Some of the other brands like Enzo Bonafe, John Lobb, etc, that other people have rec'd might not end up resonating with OP. They might, but they don't have to. I can appreciate people opening OPs eyes to other high end brands but it isn't necessary to buy them.  Hell, my most complimented shoes I have are a pair of Cole Haan Zero Grand sneaker oxford hybrids that my SO made me buy.  So a lot of the time, buying the high end shoes is only gonna matter to one person, that being the wearer. So buy whatever you want. Just make sure you do your best to get it to fit right.	labels:	episode_done:True

Monstera print got big during the heydey of cool Tumblr bloggers, and we all know Millennials love having plants of all types in their homes. Having tons of greenery in your home is still super trendy to this day. So I can definitely see why botanics have gotten big in fashion and beauty design + marketing. For me personally, I love botanics in fashion!   That said, I enjoy botanics in fashion when the colors, prints, and fabrics are unique. I'm not a fan of old-fashioned or twee pastel florals, or overdone flowers like roses, tulips, sunflowers, or daisies. I love to see olive leaves, clementines, ivy, vines, fresh sage, lemons, and interesting flowers like baby's breath, poppies, hyacinth, orchids, honeysuckle... These all look so beautiful printed on jewelry and clothes ‚Äì especially when done up on silky fabrics, printed in unique ways (asymmetrical, VERY large, VERY small, etc), and done up in really interesting colors (cream, fiery orange, poppy red, olive green, sage green, bright sky blue, eggplant...).  I think, given the popularity of greenery and eco-consciousness with Millennials (and now Gen Z), that botanics in fashion will definitely continue as a trend! But, like I said, they'll have to stay ever-evolving and modern. The bright green monstera and cacti and banana prints of 2010-2015 are out, and muted olive leaves and sage leaves and clementines are in!

text:Winston & Co. Shawl Collar Cardigan Review (But mostly preamble)	labels:Nice review :)  How do you deal with scratchy wool? Do you seek another cardigan or try other methods to mitigate the problem?
text:Thank you.  I used Eucalan wool wash on the Richmond Knitwear cardigan, it's a no-rinse wash with added Lanolin. I found the itchiness was somewhat mitigated after adding back some of those natural oils. The cardigan took 4 days to dry, but it was worth it. I'm a lot less sensitive to itchy wool than most people I know, so I'm already at an advantage though.  There's no point in having a garment you don't like wearing, so if the itchiness is such that you can't abide it...keep looking. As I said the Winston & Co. is very soft, but the quality of the wool is excellent and the final wash contributes to the soft handle.  Scottish waters are renowned for being balanced, so when rinsed they allow for a nice finish without damaging the fibres. Often times wool can be treated as part of its finishing process to soften it, but this treatment will degrade and shorten the lifespan of the yarn.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:FAQ: How do I know my clothes weren't made with slave labour?	labels:Make em yourself. But then what if the textiles were produced using slave labor?   Buy the fibers and a loom.  But what if the processing facility that produces the fiber uses slave labor to harvest?   Honestly, unless youre willing to grow your own cotton, and raise your own silkworms, and process the raw materials into a finished product...shop thrift. Give that money to your local owner instead of into the hands of a bunch of companies that make you worry about whether theyre using slave labor.  The clothes at thrift might have been produced unethically, but the local owner profits 100% from the sale of the clothing, and it doesnt support the evils.  But you can definitely produce your own silk, your own cotton, all of it. Lots of people do it, its just super fringe and takes a lot of time and patience.   Edit:Looking at other comments, its nice to see this sentiment repeated over and over.	episode_done:True
text:Does anyone else hate literally everything they put on?	labels:100%. Sometimes I'm okay with it at first but soon after, absolutely hate it. Nothing fits right. Nothing looks right. I havebt tested this theory out, yet but Ive come to the conclusion its two things. 1. Im wearing clothes that are cute but not my style. And 2. Theyre not tailored.	episode_done:True
text:How do you know if a piece of clothing is worth its price?	labels:I work in fashion and you‚Äôre spot on about the acrylic. Very uncomfortable fiber to have as a primary content on a smooth fabric. Fine if it‚Äôs in a yarn...I would say knowledge about fiber content is key, which you seem to be aware of.   There are no hard and fast retails as markers for quality in fashion. I have Uniqlo jeans for $20 that have held up pretty well. I‚Äôd say you‚Äôre spot on again when you ask about brands in this respect. Some brands offer customers a great value AND value their customers.   I agree with the comments here that say if it sparks joy and you wear it, then it‚Äôs worth the money, on both the low end and the high end.   However, shopping online can be extremely deceptive sometimes. In my experience Free People is one is the biggest offenders in this. Their stuff just looks horribly cheap once it‚Äôs in your hand.   So something that sparks joy in on a model in a photo might not once you get it home. I‚Äôd just say shop with your heart and be prepared to make returns.   Personally, I shop vintage a lot and I am pretty selective about the brands I buy new from.	episode_done:True

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - December 17, 2020	labels:I bought an Amazon basics men‚Äôs puffer jacket in a large this week and loved it when it first arrived. I really like the style of a black puffer jacket. The major issue is the cut of the jacket. At first glance it appears to fit well, but if I lean or stretch at all it cuts into my armpits. Even just putting my hands on the wheel when driving causes it to cut into my armpits. I want to find an alternative to the Amazon basics that is the same style but perhaps higher quality or a better fit. I have been looking at the Uniqlo men‚Äôs ultralight down puffer jacket. Does anyone have any experience with it or other similar jackets and know if it fits well under the armpits?  TLDR Amazon basics puffer jacket too tight under armpits. Looking for a similar jacket, perhaps the Uniqlo ultralight down jacket and looking for advice on fit.	episode_done:True
text:Revisiting Tim Gunn's List of 10 Style Must-haves	labels:To me, this is ‚Äúwardrobe staples if you have a traditional office job with a business dress code‚Äù tbh.

text:How have you changed your style and/or shopping habits after your body has changed?	labels:So my weight fluctuates quite a bit- I've gained and lost the same 20 pounds since high school. I'm not very tall so it means about a size or two difference in clothing. I basically just keep all my old clothes since I'll probably eventually fit in them down the line.. whether they're too big or too small.

text:What true heirloom pieces do you own and how do you incorporate them into your style?	labels:I wear and use my heirloom pieces inherited from my grandmother very often .  Have not altered any of them , since some of them are quite old and it would ruin the historical value .  My most interesting pieces are : A solid gold cameo set with of earrings, necklace , brooch and a ring that originaly was my great-great grandmothers , and a ruby pendant in silver from the same era (1880s 1910s) And a brooch from the napoleonic era wich is quite interresting.   My style of dress is a mix of bohemian with a good deal of influence of Edwardian (1910-17ish) sensibilites, so the jewlery work really well with that. Also have a gorgoues 50‚Äôs swing dresse that was my grandmothers, wich i have worn on ocassion. Edit to say that my grandmother was my same exact size when she was younger , so thats really fun, the clothes i have after her fits me PERFECTLY wich is great luck!  A bit controversial but i also inherited my grandmothers furs, they are still in excellent condition and i wear them almost daily in the winter months. But despite the ethical ramifications i am a firm beliver in sustainability , its better to wear and repair existing clothes then buying new .   I love the feeling of continunity i feel from wearing these treasures, that am a part of a long line of women who have worn these pieces, loved and cared for them.	episode_done:True

text:Anyone have a job that requires you to wear "work clothes" (nursing, trades, etc.)? What is your off-duty wardrobe like?	labels:Mechanic here (yeah, a dude in female fashion advise, I know). Get greasy and filthy daily but have always had a more business casual/preppy style out of work. I'll wear polo shirts on the weekend even when I'm puttering around the house and nice sweaters in the evening. As others have said, lots of out of date clothes in my closet but as a guy that matters a lot less. I like to look good and always dress for or above the occasion. Bright side is: I spend VERY little money on clothes because they last so long. Jeans? 10 years easily. Graphic T's? 5+ years, no problem. Buy the things you love and don't worry about the money because the clothes will outlive your memory of the cost.  Added bonus, my wife and I go places together and look like we own the place. Every night is a date night!	episode_done:True
text:Standard Fair and the Minimalist Sneaker [2 Week Review]	labels:Random thoughts:  Resolable sneakers weren't even on my radar screen, and I'm not sure I 'd pay extra for that in a sneaker, in spite of the fact I've bought into the whole boot thing.  The word THICC in a garment review makes me wince.  I could wear these in black, if the sole edge were also blacked out, but that drab olive is a no go for me.  Always interesting to read a thorough review, thanks.	episode_done:True
text:Psychological & personal reasons for impulse buying	labels:Yeah, I shop a lot because I'm usually sad and it feels like new items will fix that somehow, or make people miraculously like me more. I'm aware that it doesn't work like that, but I love dressing up as a "new me" every day and I easily get bored... but that's just mental issues :/  With autism and me identifying as queer and all, I'm not exactly popular and there isn't one version of me I'd consider the real me, which makes it even more difficult. "The real me" fluctuates day by day, and so do my outfit preferences. I often buy things impulsively that I WILL love for quite some time, but never on two subsequent days, for example. I've been mocked for this, but I've still found I'm happiest like this, with my crazy big wardrobe and tons of different styles.

text:If you could only have one overcoat, what would it be?	labels:I live in the southern US so I really only need one overcoat, which is currently a vintage woolrich green duffle coat I found on eBay a couple of summers ago. It‚Äôs completely wool, it blocks the wind, and it‚Äôs big enough that when things get unseasonably cold I can layer a sweater underneath. The pockets are big enough that I can stick a whole paperback in one. I love that damn coat	episode_done:True
text:Favorite brands to thrift?	labels:Honestly I don't have any. What I love about thrifting is seeing pieces removed from the context of their stores, marketing, and other items from the same brand, so I can judge them on their own merits.   I'm not trying to be condescending or corrective at all, though: If you find a brand whose clothes you tend to enjoy at a price point that works for you, more power to you!

text:Thanksgiving Outfits	labels:My uniform for thanksgiving tends to be a nice sweater with a necklace paired with leggings so i can eat all day long and not be uncomfortable, but still look decent doing it. But this year it may very well be pjs since nobody is coming over :(
text:I usually wear a t shirt dress, scarf, tights (not the shaping kind), and booties for this reason.	labels:This is brilliant.  I used to always be a dude at Thanksgiving and wear slacks or jeans, so I'm really loving this idea of wearing something that isn't constricting around the waist!
text:I hate pants unless they‚Äôre leggings, so I never wear them. I have all kinds of dresses, but for something like Thanksgiving I definitely prefer a looser dress. I‚Äôve also done a wrap dress for Christmas, because I can slightly loosen the waist.	labels:I can get down with jeans that are comfy, I kind of enjoy the feeling of wearing jeans actually. Mostly I live in shorts and skirts, but there is also something comfy to me about wearing something longer and which kinda hugs your body. But when you're celebrating a holiday that revolves around eating a huge meal, it's pretty much the worst thing. Everyone in pants just sitting around being uncomfortable after the meal until they leave Grandpa's house and finally get to undo their fly. Lol. A loose dress does sound a lot more pleasant.  While I transitioned years ago, I usually see conservative family on the holidays, so I still try to dress up en masc, and it's a little ridiculous. Will be nice to have a smaller gathering with just close fam this year (siblings and my mom only, all of whom live together).	episode_done:True
text:Small Interesting Brands That You Should Follow	labels:Do not hate me as that guy, but I wish that Graziano site offered more information on the artisan clothing (Oaxaca and Chiapas). They're selling those pieces "in collaboration" with the communities for $200~ like the Sarape or Poncho, but 1) those items are clearly made and mostly designed entirely by the people from those communities and 2) that kind of artisan clothes usually cost around $10-$40 when you buy them directly from the producers or on Mexican websites. I don't worry much about the price of the clothes on the website, but I do worry that they could be making a humongous 90% profit by just reselling
text:You could always contact them! Their instagram is always active and you should be able to get a response. Also from what I know, the fabrics are certified organic and are from small specific mills. Also Alejandro makes all the clothes by hand. If I'm not mistaken, Alejandro is also mexican and is doing work based on his heritage. Small businesses like these don't make 90% profit because it takes time, money and effort to create a small amount of clothing.   As for myself, I'm not 100% sure on mexican traditional clothing and how much they cost but I know that their western style clothing is worth the price. It's a different style of clothing that you don't really see and something special like this is worth the price at times.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What are some unexpected surprises you've found with certain clothing brands that are known for other things?	labels:I was surprised that Abercrombie wasn't just mall crap for teenagers anymore. It's not the heritage company it once was either, it's just a lower-end mall brand now with a lot of solid basics.

I'm always way more interested in what they're wearing when they're not getting paid by some megacorp.  I will say I have weird love for some of the older George (edit: from Wal-Mart) stuff (like from years ago) that I can find on ThredUp periodically, some of the dresses from 10 or so years ago are actually pretty great and wear well.

If you follow me on IG that's the easiest way to hear about updates, but I can edit this comment when it's refreshed, too!   **(11/30 update if anybody is still reading -- the app is updated!)**  Edit: since so many of you are finding the tool mostly useless, I just wanted to say that the goal was to create something that would help you find fashion inspo from people who are more similar in size to you than a fashion model in a magazine.  Of course it's impossible to get an exact body double from just 3 measurements, but that's what the standard is, and that's what I could reasonably expect the average person to know about themselves. I have to make sure that the barrier to entry is very low. The more people can join this index, the more useful it is. Please remember that I offer this tool completely for free, that I don't work in the fashion industry, and that I don't have any background in the industry (fashion, data, or web design). I just wanted to do something helpful for the community. I will try my best to make as many improvements as I can over time, but I have very limited resources, and maintaining it is quite a lot of effort as is. Sorry, all!

I am an aspie and I buy things because they look beautiful, often not even using it, just because I have the inner urge to take it with me because it is beautiful and I also think others maybe think it's beautiful and so they maybe like and accept me more. My wardrobe is crazy as well, like elegant, boho, goth, japanese fashion, girly stuff lol But it's so destructive to buy so much stuff. I found out I'm trying to fill the void in my soul with it and am only impulse buying when I either found a new special interest (at least a bit understandable) or when feeling lonely, depressive and not motivated for any hobbies.

text:Distinct Fashion Phases	labels:I‚Äôm Op but I‚Äôll share mine -  At around 14 I had a quick phase of really liking the very early sort of e- kid bright and trendy fashion. Hot topic forever 21 sort of edgy stuff. Skinny jeans only. Small wardrobe. Didn‚Äôt look great and got bullied a little for my new look. Lowkey wanted to look like a gorillaz character. Still kinda do though lol.  Then there was a transitional trendy masculine street wear phase from when I was late 14 to late 15 . I only really wore ripped jeans, graphic tees , always a belt , with vans or converse that matched the shirt. I started getting of compliments on my style from peers.  I then had an art kid style phase late 15 - 16 years old . Very similar to before but I started adding different style jackets and pants. This was an important phase because I started adding different accessories like print socks and hair stuff.   Really quick 90‚Äôs inspired phase. I tried dressing like 90‚Äôs Britpop singers lol. A small step back I‚Äôd say.   Late 16 to current ( I‚Äôm seventeen ) changed my style over quarantaine . Asking questions here changed everything. I realized how much I loved my more dressy clothes and fell in love with the l‚Äôecole des femmes clothes. I stopped following trends and went for mature more romantic and currently Victorian styles. Man repeller slightly masculine inspiration too. I wear skirts, tights , blazers, dresses, hats, neck scarves and blouses now. I also sold my years worth of converse and vans to buy oxfords and heeled dress shoes. Though my peers understand it a little less I have never been happier. Very confident in my style currently.    [Quick note - It may seem crazy to change my style so quickly but when your young you tend to go through clothes more quickly as you grow and teens tend to be more rough on clothes ]   Thank you for reading : )
text:I love this because I had almost the complete opposite transition. I went from aspiring to have a slightly dressy, classic style 14-16, and then in the past year and a half (17 now too lol), I had a drastic shift towards recognizing that as put together as dressier styles look, it‚Äôs not for me.   Luckily, I barely had any clothes anyway, so heading off to college soon, I decided to focus on what I actually value (comfort above all, feeling like myself in clothes, and replacing things I currently wear a ton) and now find myself in a much more colorful (unless i‚Äôm feeling all black), streetwear-esque look. Yesterday, I wore an outfit that I can‚Äôt stop grinning about today, and that never used to happen before. Absolutely ecstatic getting to play with clothes in a way that isn‚Äôt 100% ‚Äútrendy‚Äù and is just more *me*.	labels:	episode_done:True

I would stick with JCrew, JCrew factory is like Old Navy plus $20.	episode_done:True

text:Are LBD‚Äôs really a MUST?	labels:I'd say it's not a must. It all depends on your life and your own style. I don't have an LBD, but I do have a navy dress that I could wear to work and go out and even to weddings - with the right accessories, of course. I think that's the whole point of the LBD - it's supposed to be a "blank canvas" type of clothes that goes with everything and you can accessorize it to fit the occasion. However, if you already have enough clothes for every occasion in your life, then it's definitely not necessary to go out and buy an LBD just because it's on some list of must-haves.

text:Are LBD‚Äôs really a MUST?	labels:Black and white are too harsh on my skin so a LBD and a white blouse are pointless in my wardrobe. I have a grey linen sheath dress, an olive green a line linen dress and a navy dress with white flowers in a sateen fabric. All three of these dresses are from Target and are my go to dresses for events. The sheath dress and the navy dress have been worn to weddings, Christmas dinners,  interviews and school pictures. My green dress is my go to when I don't know what to wear and want to feel good. If you already have an interview outfit then I would consider getting a cocktail dress in a fabric and print/colour that you love. I had a coral pink lace dress that took me to weddings, graduations, fancy lunches and theatre performances until I grew out of it. I changed up the accessories and nobody commented even though it was memorable. How many dress up events happen at this point in your life? Dress for the life you have now. Also, the best time to pick up a cocktail dress seems to be around horse racing carnivals.	episode_done:True

Search online against my favourite brands 5. Search against sales 6. If the stars align and points 4 and 5 meet, it was meant to be and I pull the trigger. If 5 can't be met, I'd muse through a bit longer 7. Be smug in my decision to buy after all that research 8. Itch scratched 9. Repeat  Sometimes I also impulse buy and then see how much I want to return the item lol.	episode_done:True
text:What Did You Recently Get Rid of From Your Closet (and How, Please Help Me Help Myself)	labels:Konmari only worked a little for me, as I find joy having clothes to meet any occasion including weight going up or down. Also clothes are more like a hobby and also sentimental so doing them first never made sense to me.   What's worked best over the years is more of a "container" strategy. Let's take your socks for an example. I allot only so much room for socks in one section of a drawer. Those socks with holes are going right out, I don't have room for them and I'm not making room for holey socks. I would take the cue that these socks were so well loved they got holes, so I am fine with finding a similar replacement, then tossing the holey socks to make room for a similar pair I know I'm going to love and wear a lot.   Work stuff and COVID is so much more difficult. Pre-COVID I traveled a lot for work so needed to pretty much maintain a 4-season all weather occasion work wardrobe for all cultural possibilities and their nuances. That's long been 80% of my wardrobe.   But now here we are. And everything's been turned on its head, and that 80% wardrobe is just gathering dust, while the 20% is getting worn 80% of the time. Who am I kidding... more like 100% of the time!  But I'm not ready to declutter my work wear because when we have a vaccine and we're back to normal work schedules, it would be too costly to replace all of it. Especially if somewhere along the line I was laid off.  So for now I've basically SCRUNCHED all my work wardrobe into the smallest possible footprint to make more room for the stuff I'm actually wearing. And re-shuffled so the stuff I'm actually wearing is front and center and the other items are harder to access.   The cool thing is WFH means you can do laundry more often, so no, you do not need a month's worth of loungewear, tees, leggings. You just don't.	episode_done:True

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - January 09, 2021	labels:Are zip up hoodies still in style? What's popular?
text:I think a non zip hoodie is a universally better option. I also strongly disagree with getting a merino or cashmere one - it‚Äôs only going to make them look more awkward due to the material vs style formality clash. Stick to simple cotton if you really prefer a zip up over a pull over.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Jeans: Recommendations and Reviews	labels:Honestly I think you have to give way more detail on your old pair and what you‚Äôre looking for.  In my mind the biggest hurdle to perfect jeans is the fit, and since every body is different this is highly individual. Some people might prefer stretchier denim for a more forgiving fit, while others look for stiffer fabric, and have less leeway.   Personally I still struggle to find a high rise, non cropped, fits my thighs and waist, plain dark wash, straight/skinny, 90% or more cotton, pair of jeans. But hopefully I‚Äôll find it eventually!
text:My jeans criteria are similar. I wear men's APCs.	labels:Thanks for the tip! I‚Äôm a little skeptical of men‚Äôs jeans though because I have 24‚Äù thighs, 39‚Äù hips and 29‚Äù waist. I‚Äôm trying to find a tailor I like to see if I can get my newest pair altered, b cause it fits the rest of my standards.
text:Also I don‚Äôt know about the APC jeans, but most men‚Äôs jeans that I find are 9‚Äù rose or lower. I‚Äôm into selvedge jeans and the most selection can be found in men‚Äôs styles, but very seldom do I find any jeans with 10‚Äù+ rise in men‚Äôs. 10‚Äù is my bare minimum...and those are mid-rise on me. 11‚Äù is a minimum for high-rise.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Hooded Sweatshirt Roundup	labels:Once you get over a certain level of $ point, it's really hard to rank basic hoodies over one another, it mostly comes down to the fit that you want.  I've tried a lot of hoodies from cheap to expensive and most of them are as comfortable as each other. The article mentions JEs villain hoodies which are probably out of fashion these days but JE still produces other cuts of hoodies such as the beach hoodie, raglan hoodie and oversized cropped hoodie which all have different fits and are all as well made as each other. People who rave about a particular brand of hoodie are highly likely to be just really happy with the fit, the quality and comfort isn't gonna really differ between RC, Norse Projects, Champion and such. Even coveted things like loopwheeler also doesn't provide anything unique either when it comes to comfort.  I've rambled but if I had an advice to give to hoodie buyers who are mostly focused on fit and comfort, it would be to identify a fit that you want and just start from the midrange brand that you can find of that fit.
text:I bought a JE zip up hoodie. I also have Stone Island and Burberry hoodies, as well as American Apparel and other cheaper ones. I won't say spending $300+ (cad) on hoodies is smart, but the main difference I note is the cut. Comfort, like you said, isn't too different unless you get into cashmere, but the difference in cut and overall shape and sizing is much better. I definitely wanna get my hands on a Todd Snyder Champion hoodie though, that's right up my alley.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:How do you handle budget increases when it comes to clothes? (ex. going from student to working professional)	labels:I finished up grad school last year and started working full time, so I totally went through that transition. For me, I don‚Äôt have a set clothing budget, but I do have a monthly ‚Äúwants‚Äù budget that clothing purchases go into. I try to be strategic and identify gaps in my wardrobe and work from there, buying things as I have the money/need for them. It has been a big change going from mostly buying secondhand to having more to spend, but I still love to thrift/posh etc. My budget now is significantly more than it was in grad school though, so I have more flexibility.   One of the more difficult parts for me was feeling like I needed nicer, high quality items for work. Those get expensive! For example I recently bought a wool dress coat since I only had a parka. I am lucky in that my work is quite casual, so most of my wardrobe works for both work and casual stuff.	episode_done:True

text:People who've been working from home for most of 2020 - do you think your work style will change when you go back to the office (compared to your work wardrobe pre-lockdown)? If so, how?	labels:Yes and no.   I have been wearing way more loungewear - and all day loungewear. I have been going to my workout class and it feels silly to change clothes midday to get ready for an afternoon class. I would bring a change of clothes before of course.   One of my fashion goals for this year was getting better at separates. I am practicing this! In the before times I wore more dresses. I haven‚Äôt been doing it as much because my desk area is a little chilly. I have a few looks I am happy with and should translate nicely.   I did wear some of my dresses during the summer. But more solid ones vs patterned ones. I have been also experimenting with solids this year.   I have been wearing way more pants so that will likely translate in the future. Surprisingly. I have avoided pants a lot in the past.   I can‚Äôt wait to get back to my fave shoes and the dresses I have missed - that feel a little wrong for sitting at home. My wardrobe has gone through a massive shift over the past 5 years when I started biking for errands.  This means I mostly buy items that are bike friendly. And that works well for sitting at home as well. I have snuck in a skirt or two that may not work on my bike - and jeans which I hate biking in - but one the whole that rule serves me well.	episode_done:True

text:How much was your most expensive fashion item and when or how often do you wear it?	labels:My most expensive items are my Native American Turquoise jewelry and my cowboy boots. Just purchased a huge $900 squash blossom necklace and have worn it constantly. My boots range from $30 for a secondhand pair to $750 for custom made and none are worn more or less than the others.  When my mother passed, she was 88. I went to clean out her closet and drawers and found so many lovely things that were carefully boxed away or wrapped in tissue that she was ‚Äúsaving for good‚Äù. Ironically, ‚Äúgood‚Äù apparently never came as these things went unused.  I decided right then to never do that. Every day is special and I am worth taking the time to look and feel special even if I‚Äôm just out running errands.
text:So jealous! I want a squash blossom badly, I love a big statement necklace worn with all black.	labels:Meeee toooooo! Almost everything else I wear is thrifted, so I save a ton of money on clothes every year. This allows me to put aside $100-$150 a month to save up for these types of purchases. My husband is all for it because we share some of the larger cuffs and certain necklaces/bolos, so he paws through the collection too when we get dressed to go out.

text:What's your fashion miracle?	labels:I used to wear small diamond earrings every day, and would put them in my wallet when I went to the gym after work. I got to work the next day and realized I forgot to put them back in after the gym, so I opened up my wallet and they were gone. I had made my usual morning stop for breakfast on the way to work, so I rushed to the food cart and looked all over the sidewalk but I couldn‚Äôt find them.  At least 1-2 weeks later I went to the same food cart for breakfast, looked down, and saw one diamond earring in the crack in the sidewalk. I looked more closely and there was the other one! The metal was chewed up (they were bezel set) so I had to get them repaired, but it was a lot cheaper than a new pair!   Definitely my #1 fashion (jewelry?) miracle.
text:I'm glad you found them! This reminds me of my mother's similar miracle with her wedding ring! Her ring is not fancy, it has a single, small round diamond in a gold 6-prong setting.   Well, the stone fell out at some point, and my mother didn't know exactly where or when. We all looked everywhere, but how do you even start to look for something that's only a few mm? We scoured the house with flashlights looking for any sparkle. We even cut open the vacuum bag and sifted through everything, same everytime someone swept or dusted. Replacing it was not an expense my parents could really afford.   A few weeks later she'd given up and had decided it would have to be replaced somehow...until she noticed a small sparkle on the [very narrow] back rim of the top loading washer by the hinge of the lid. No clue how it didn't just fall into the washer when she put the clothes in! My best guess is it fell out of a pocket and that's where it landed.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Is Money Important for Style? - The Style and Direction Podcast	labels:I was thinking about this in relation to my own style -- where I spend and where I don't. For instance, I'm really particular about how dress clothes fit, so I spend a lot on tailoring because it matters there. Other big ticket items are outerwear, because they tend to dominate an outfit. However, I definitely spend less on casual/basic things like jeans, tees, and chinos. Often, I'll wear $20 chinos with a $50 sweater, a $600 jacket and $200 shoes, so the price-per-piece for certain outfits are often from the different tiers. To me, it's about knowing what items are truly "making the outfit" and spending the most where it matters.

text:What Are Your Regional Fashion Stereotypes?	labels:Columbus, Oh - I'd believe it if you told me that everyone under 25 bought all their clothes at abercrombie and everybody over 25 bought their clothes at JC Penny
text:I'm from the north side of cbus and my local mall had a different store for every single iteration of Chico's and Talbot's at one point. Men, Kids, Maternity, the list goes on and on and I think that really says something about the regional fashion sense.  Also worth noting that L Brands stores predominate because Les Wexner owns columbus.	labels:cursed be his name	episode_done:True
text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE!- October 23	labels:2 Questions here.  1. Is there a difference in quality between buying 501 Levi's from Amazon versus buying 501 Levi's from their store (physical location, not website)? Amazon pricing is half that of their store's. 2. Any recommendations for a good turtleneck, preferably not too thick of a material, something to layer under a jacket.
text:Possibly but there is no way to tell   Some claim they make outlet quality versions of mainline jeans. Not sure I believe that. With Levis ubiquitous sales you could probably get 501s from the Levi website for close to the same price with Black Friday coming up.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Boba's Ultra Basic Steps For Developing Style and Outfits (version 1)	labels:I've taken a couple of laps before writing this comment, but up-front I think aesthetics section should be split, because I think the most basic question, which is answered aesthetically but not functionally, is what do you want your clothes to **do**? Giving off a vibe is mentioned, but there's an even more functional level of "are these clothes sensible for how I live my life?" Are you buying lots of hawaiian shirts even though live at the north pole, or buying down parkas when you live in Hawaii? Do you regularly find yourself cold and wet because you don't own any raincoats, or find that your fishnet sleeves keep getting caught on the mill in the machine shop, or that your raw denim really doesn't give you the flexibility you need to dance?   I think what the clothes do should meet you where you do what you do, and at the most basic level that's physically enabling you to do things, and you can build a vibe from that.
text:Honestly the biggest drawback of dancing in raws is they‚Äôre hot as balls haha but I agree.  I love Barbour jackets but they‚Äôre useless in CO where it never rains	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Do you: 1) keep all of your wardrobe equally diverse, or 2) keep all of your wardrobe minimal, or 3) keep some pieces relatively similar while diversifying others?	labels:My closet definitely has #3 vibes. I go out of my way to thrift EVERYTHING besides specific pieces I‚Äôm in need of. I have a very boho/neo-hippy style with some funky pieces. When it comes to bottoms, I like to be consistent with skinny jeans, mom cut jeans, and harem pants. Then, I usually style a patterned shirt or t shirt with basic pants. If I have some funky pants, I‚Äôll throw on a mono colored shirt. For shoes, I almost always wear docs (I have a black 1460 8-eye pair & a brown 1460 pascal leather pair) or vans (my 20 year-old spirit is shining through lol).	episode_done:True

text:Is the high fashion industry a little tone-deaf for F/W 2020?	labels:You know not everyone is privileged enough to have a work from home job right now right? And to pay for grocery delivery? And to have access to private outdoors spaces? Some people still have to leave the house and would like to look stylish doing so.
text:No no, fashion isn't for grocery store employees and Starbucks baristas come now /s  OP, I dont think you're coming from a bad place, but this post is really tone deaf	labels:I think I was misinterpreted. I'm not offended by the trends, I'm disappointed to see the same types of fall trends we've seen the last few years show up despite the desire from a large number of people to feel pretty and stay comfy. I know my personal disappoinment is not shared by most in this sub, and I've been rightfully reminded that collections take time to develop and release. But don't twist my words by implying that I said fashion should be gatekept. Like any other element of culture and art it does not exist in a vacuum. And I'm sure plenty of essential workers, friends and family of mine included, can desire comfort on the job as well.	episode_done:True
text:In Honor of RBG, What is your Dissent piece?	labels:A pair of great quality, black leather high heels with a slight platform sole, may not sound like much but they give me 5 inches extra height and I‚Äôm already 5‚Äô8‚Äù, walking in to meetings in those gives me an edge as I‚Äôm often the tallest one there.

text:How many pairs of jeans and pairs of shoes should you own?	labels:Women can have things they enjoy having without being concern trolled about how much they really need it.   I don't see men getting hassled for the amount of electronic waste their hobbies produce.   I doubt every fifth post in the Funko Pop subreddit is about curbing consumption and how they should be rethinking their involvement in a plastics based interest.   Personally, I think they're wasteful as shit, but I'm not about to roll up into their space and shame them for it.  I'm so over the handwringing, guilt, and joylessness about fashion in this sub sometimes.

text:Can you have a clothing style without actually wearing that certain style much?	labels:This isn‚Äôt a direct answer to your question, but I‚Äôve found I have a ‚Äòhopeful‚Äô sense of style and a ‚Äòrealistic‚Äô sense of style.  Hopeful-me will think about buying a teal floral wrap dress because it‚Äôs gorgeous. Realistic-me knows it will sit in my closet untouched for 3 years because I don‚Äôt wear teal!   I‚Äôve learned to differentiate between the two while I shop, at least. If I was a celebrity suddenly, maybe I would lean towards hopeful-me‚Äôs style, but for now I am normal and realistic!
text:Yes this! I call it ‚Äúideal style‚Äù and ‚Äúreal style‚Äù. My ‚Äúideal style‚Äù involves a lot of flowy, Christy Dawn-style dresses. My actual, ‚Äúreal style‚Äù is way more simple - in my free time I wear a lot of plain t-shirts, sweaters, and jeans/shorts. I‚Äôve bought a couple of absolutely lovely dresses over the years that I never wear, but will reach for my favorite Everlane t-shirts and comfy sweaters over and over again.	labels:I call it my "aspirational" me.

text:As Chanel Raises Prices For A Second Time this Year, What Do Luxury Brands‚Äô Inflating Prices Mean for Them & for the Industry at Large?	labels:Luxury brands inflating prices means creating another pricepoint at higher categories. When fashion tees at $300 a pop becomes the norm, why wouldn't the luxury brands jack up the price on other products to increase their margins?  The only way this can be curbed is through the consumers. When we stop falling into the hype cycle and scramble to buy up everything just for the gram and social media likes, these products will sit and go into the 50-60% off discount during the sale seasons. All these brands have data; when they see that stuff is sitting and mostly selling at lower price points, they'll need to curb their expectations and set price points accordingly.   It doesn't help right now during COVID that I see people whose jobs/income did not get affected by COVID, and therefore has additional disposable income because they aren't eating out, partying etc. They justify spending more on items at MSRP instead of waiting for a sale.

text:How do I improve my fashion sense beyond just tshirt and jeans?	labels:I used to always wear jeans and t-shirts too (and still do a lot of the time), but what has helped me is just paying attention to people around me and what they wear. Friends, acquaintances, strangers. For me, this helps a lot more than looking online because I feel like I can't really tell what the clothes look like in real life.  TV shows or movies help too, where I can see how the clothing a character wears contributes to their "vibe" and matches their personality or other things the creators want to show. Sometimes that's even better than real life because so much thought goes into what the characters wear and what it says about them.  A big barrier for me was the cost of buying new clothes when I'm not really sure if I'll like them long-term, so it's helped to borrow or trade clothes with friends to try new things out. One of my friends used to organize a big clothing swap once a year. Thrift stores, Facebook buying & selling groups, and discount places are also a good option.  Another barrier was that I had only really seen fashion as being about creating a feminine image and emphasizing a slim body type. I would always be upset with my body for not looking like that. I've recently learned I feel much more myself in more androgynous and masc clothing, which I think is why I liked jeans and T-shirts so much. Realizing what I actually like to look like makes it feel a lot more natural and intuitive.	episode_done:True

If you have a MasterClass pass anyway I‚Äôd say watch it, but I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs worth it for more experienced folks. He talks about building a capsule wardrobe and drives home what basics you need, but I was not impressed with his demonstrations of styling a dress. Perhaps if he had shown a more advanced view of styling with accessories and creating a look, but it was very entry level. There‚Äôs also a bit about building your confidence and believing in yourself.	episode_done:True

Or if you‚Äôre craving to completely stray from your usual habits, I‚Äôd go for a trouser or carpenter pant since those also seem to be widely available and in style!	episode_done:True
text:Are jean shorts on men really that bad?	labels:I don't think they look bad, I just find the concept weird.  It's summer, it's hot so you're wearing shorts, but the shorts are made from denim which is a hot and sweaty material. It's an oxymoron to me, like have you got your legs out to stay cool or have you got the denim on to stay warm? What's going on here?
text:I wear them almost exclusively in the summer. Cut off jorts and bands shirts. I just think shorts made from other material just aren‚Äôt my style or something... when I wear them they just look like I‚Äôm trying to look ‚Äúpreppy‚Äù or something. I wear chinos to work. I wear skinny clothes always. I wear beat up Vans and cut off jean shorts at home. I just can‚Äôt do fabric shorts.	labels:Have you tried baggies from Patagonia?	episode_done:True
text:Do you have a childhood fashion icon?

Outfits always cute, but accessible/not over the top

text:[Serious answers only] FAQ: Why does runway fashion looks like nothing you'd ordinarily wear on the daily?	labels:The best response I‚Äôve ever heard for this question was comparing runway high fashion to the concept cars you‚Äôll see at auto shows. Those cars will often never make it into production but that‚Äôs not the point. The point is to show off new materials, technologies, design philosophies or to generally stir up interest in a brand. Same for fashion.
text:But I feel like unlike runway fashion, concept cars are more appealing to the masses, even if they ultimately can't afford them.	labels:It doesn't make much sense; a businessperson will always look more on-point with a futuristic funny-looking sportscar than a geometric nightmare of a peacoat.	episode_done:True

text:Discussion: LGBTQIA+ Signaling, Presentation, and Commodification in Fashion	labels:I‚Äôm queer and i have definitely felt like i had to dress more ‚Äúqueer‚Äù, even though i am still closeted. No one was pressuring me, but it was more like me just wanting to fit into that archetype, of the cool queer who dresses vaguely androgynously with the beanies, baseball caps and dad shirts (but i really do love a good buttonup). But ultimately, that isn‚Äôt me. I prefer more feminine (typically feminine, if you will) outfits.

text:Skirts and dresses in winter - how to look good and be warm with a combo of boots, socks, tights?	labels:This may not be everyone's cup of tea but I love wearing oversized long sweaters or sweater dresses with sheer tights and then thigh highs over that. I'll usually wear this with combat boots or some type of heeled boot as ankle booties don't look great on me. You can also wear this with a skirt/shorts and a sweater and then a coat on top.

text:Have your clothing purchases dramatically dropped now that we can't go anywhere?	labels:Yes... until this month when I just went fuck it, and splurged on a bunch of loungewear. And now I‚Äôve been bitten by the shopping bug again and want all the shoes, and contemplating whether I would actually wear a leather button up or if it‚Äôs just sit in my closet looking pretty...
text:I did the same thing back in may when it became clear that we weren‚Äôt going back to the office full time and I could do my work while drinking coffee in bed. If it makes you feel better I spent like $500 on loungewear and it feels great to have new loungy clothes, otherwise I bought myself a new scarf and two tops for my bday. My new obsession is masks, I have the bedazzled powerpuff  girls mask from Honeiibeth (shameless plug, their designs are so cute and they deserve the exposure) and I think I‚Äôm going to grab 2 more.	labels:Haha I resisted for a long time but now that it‚Äôs cold and I‚Äôm wearing sweatpants full time, I caved.

text:Changing Your Habits: Deciding to Not Shop Brands for Ethical or Other Reasons & Following Through	labels:Something I haven't seen mentioned here is clothing swaps. My friends and I are in the habit of having them at least a few times a year, and everyone walks out happy. If your friends don't do this, offer to host! We even had a Halloween costume version where we all traded outfits we no longer wanted.   Today I found success on Etsy. I was looking for tops that were ethically made, vegan, not culturally appropriative, affordable, and from a Black-owned business. I found lots of incredibly expensive brands on Google, but on Etsy I found smaller artists. So no slavery concerns (most likely), and it meets all my requirements. It only scratches the surface, but it's a place to start. It's about being intentional within the constraints.  I'm fortunate to be able to afford more expensive pieces, but wow is it hard to even know where to go. I don't shop a lot, so I really struggle with vintage and second-hand stores that only show clothing on mannequins. Before the pandemic, I never shopped online, but I also hated shopping in person because I struggled to find stores that had things I liked. It's so much easier to go into Urban or H&M or Loft. And we think of places like H&M and Forever 21 as the pinnacles of fast fashion, but I assume the worst of basically any major brand. Victoria's Secret, Gap, even luxury brands like Gucci or Prada, I assume they cut as many corners as possible.   Trying to find clothes within all my constraints helped me discover some amazing pieces that I am so excited to buy. They're incredible statement pieces that I never would have found without being more intentional in my purchases.	episode_done:True

Unless we‚Äôre talking about crippling debt or something you can‚Äôt pay off within 9-12 months while still living comfortably, there‚Äôs no reason to cut all spending.

Take it easy and be realistic, you‚Äôll be okay!	episode_done:True
text:The Instagram Account Showing ‚ÄúIvy‚Äôs‚Äù More Eclectic Side ‚Äì Put This On	labels:Very impressed by this article.

text:Brooks Brothers's Future Looks a Lot Like Menswear‚Äôs Past	labels:* Less SKUs. The amount of stuff BB sells is overwhelming.  * Do away with there weirdly named fit system. Change it to Extra Slim, Slim, Regular, Thicc Daddies * Revamp the BB website. It's been terrible for a long time. * Have the athleisure stuff, but also focus on high quality basics, again with less SKUs. Have something like an "essentials" line. The Navy Suit. The Charcoal Suit. The OCDB. The Chino. The Wool Trouser. Without fifty million variations thereof. You go now and it's like here are three navy suits with different kinds of stretch, here are four more with some kind of temperature controlling fabric. Just give me a half to full canvas lined 100% wool navy suit in various fits and sizes. In other words, simplify your menswear line to cut down on SKUs, and that will give you more room to play with sheep on skis and stuff (i think that does sound kind of cute, very Ralph Lauren). * Do away with Golden Fleece, Red Fleece. Mainline only. Again confusing to the consumer. * Where BB could play more is in areas like sport shirts. By all means offer your classics like blackwatch etc., but other menswear shops like Sid Mashburn or Todd Snyder offer all kinds of fun prints and colors while still feeling like classic #menswear.  i dunno, just riffing my own personal desires for BB. i don't know anything about running a large clothing manufacturer and retailer.

text:What true heirloom pieces do you own and how do you incorporate them into your style?	labels:One of my great aunts gave me a great silver and turquoise matching ring and bracelet set she got out West probably in the 50‚Äôs and likely as a souvenir even though it‚Äôs nice quality silver and real turquoise. I also have a small beaded purse from her, it looks quite older, maybe 1930‚Äôs. I only use it for special occasions and otherwise it just sits on my dresser looking pretty. The same great aunt was the oldest of my grandmothers siblings and gave them fancy dresses from a lady she worked for to play dress up in. Later my mom played dress up in them and so did I. I wish we had realized how nice they were because they‚Äôre in rough shape now even though I‚Äôve saved them. They‚Äôre probably 1920‚Äôs, one is silk and could possibly be repaired enough to look nice displayed.   My mom did her own sewing and saved a lot of her favorite clothes. I still wear some of her 70‚Äôs maxi dresses but she wore her dresses too short in the late 60‚Äôs for me to wear most of them as an adult. There‚Äôs one wool jumper dress I wear over leggings.   When I was in high school I wore her 1980‚Äôs Calvin Klein jeans, the ones with the white labels instead of the modern leather patch.   My aunt gave me some of my grandmothers costume jewelry and it started my love affair with tacky mid century jewelry.	episode_done:True
text:Does anyone else always hesitate to buy what they truly love because they don't have a social life?	labels:Outside of Covid,  I am perfectly happy to wear fancier than necessary clothes to work out while running errands.

I just want to wear a ball gown once a year,  is that too much to ask?
text:Back when I went to more parties or went out more, I would do that - get way over dressed just because I wanted to.  I was with my friends, they knew I was weird.  I don't really have a group like that anymore and I miss having those opportunities to get fancy.	labels:	episode_done:True

I bought Swarovski (the touchstone stuff) off my neighbor- the All Around Necklace I think it was called- over the summer so when we finally do this I have all the right pieces for the goal look.    Now that you mention it, I've been buying pieces I haven't touched because they're meant for public not sitting at home browsing Hulu in my infinite boredom.  There's a mauve mini dress with tie sleeves, a blue and white "porcelain" print dress, an ankle length plaid A line skirt...

Is there a sweater brand that tends to be lightweight or more breathable that I can try? Is there a certain sweater material or knit that works this way?  Budget $130 Location US / EU  Side note: I'm pretty wedded to the crewneck, and I avoid cashmere because I've always found it to be too delicate. If I brush gently against a hedge on the sidewalk, I don't want to end up with a big hole in my sweater. I don't need the softest feel, and I appreciate all textures.
text:You can get cotton sweaters that will be lighter weight. Acrylic, too, which will last but usually feels like shit and won't breathe as well depending on how tightly it's knit, but if you're wearing a shirt underneath it's not too much of an issue.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Menswear I Drool Over: FW/2021 Part III	labels:Yup I don't get fashion, none of these looks do it for me. Are you looking at it from the "huh, that neat in an artistic way" or "I wish I could incorporate that style element into my facade". Cause I might like some of the fabrics used or the way the cut highlights the figure but none of this stuff is wearable for me at least.
text:Assuming you're not trying to troll, I'll give you a solid answer.   I went to schools that had uniforms, for 8 years, the same thing ad infinitum. I love high fashion/couture and its been like that since I was a kid. It's art. I used to just admire the looks that came down the runway. Now when I look at lines, I put them in my cart and buy what I like *(on sale cause retail is for suckerssss).* I can't be bothered with business casual looks & fast fashion like H&M, Gap, Asos, J. Crew, etc. I'm simply sharing my aesthetic. Not everyone likes an abstract Picasso, but they understand that it's art nonetheless.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:why are men's clothing generally not as expensive and better quality?	labels:The fabric content and construction methods  selected for menswear tend to be more durable (wool, Tweed, twill, cotton/cotton blend, denim, tencil, natural and synthetic suiting). It is also considered feminine to buy a broader range of colors and lighter weight fabrics so most retailers don't get trendier colors and fabric weights when stocking menswear because they don't think it will sell. It's more to do with risk aversion and gender assumptions than planned obsolescence.   I did menswear design in school and now that I'm learning to sew for myself, it's very challenging. Women's garments have more variety, but the weight of many of the fabrics with better drape are pretty flimsy.	episode_done:True
text:How did you find your style/tips for a cohesive style	labels:I've spent so much of quarantine trying to find my personal style! Here's what worked for me:  I got all the clothes I regularly, reliably wear, and I laid them out on my bed. Then, I wrote down some observations about them. The materials, the colors, the styles, the patterns...anything that seemed noteworthy. I realized I had three different color palettes going on, so I grouped them accordingly. After assessing everything, I tried to come up with a few adjectives to describe what I was looking at in front of me, and those adjectives became how I describe my personal style. In other words, rather than gravitating toward an aesthetic and trying to make my wardrobe fit into it, I just looked and described what my style, in practice, as it already exists, is.   And ever since I loosely nailed it down, now I make sure that any new clothes I purchase relatively fit those descriptors too. So everything I own is pretty stylistically compatible. :)	episode_done:True

text:Is anyone into MBTI? Do you feel like your fashion preferences align with your personality type?	labels:INTJ. I basically wear the same outfit every day with (slightly) different colors and fabrics. Long sleeve, fitted, shallow v-neck shirt/sweater; "cigarette" style pants/jeans (or joggers while working from home/being comfy); ankle boots or pointed flats. Everything is solid color; some color blocking when I am feeling adventurous. Everything I wear in public fits well, and any structured piece gets tailored. I like nice fabrics, and the clothing \*must\* make \*me\* look good.  If I could get away with it, everything in my closet would be navy (or at least a dark color). After being accused many times of wearing the same outfit multiple times a week, I have learned to add in flashes of color/accessories to make it clear that yes I am indeed wearing a different outfit than yesterday thanks.

text:How much of your income do you spend on average in clothes every month?	labels:On a good month I have ¬£120. This is to be split on everything that's not groceries & basic household consumables, healthcare, rent or bills. So it's spent on going out, clothes, skincare, stuff for the house that's not consumables, presents, etc. I would spend ¬£100-¬£200 on a new item of clothing, less on second-hand. So as you might guess, I don't buy a lot of clothes! What I buy I wear until THE END.   Edit: I should mention that I work part-time so I would spend less than an average person. It's a trade off - more time, less golds.	episode_done:True
text:How do you guys work towards avoiding fast fashion?	labels:You don't have to make your own clothes, but learning to do some basic repairs (reattaching buttons, patching a small hole or fixing a split seam with needle and thread, maybe using a sweater shaver/depiller or waterproofing your leather shoes) can be really helpful in making things last and look nice longer - so maybe your 2 pound shirt lasts 3 years instead of 2, which means you don't need to buy as many in the long run.	episode_done:True
text:Casual Fridays - What do you like to wear?	labels:I see business casual as an opportunity to express yourself a bit more. My casual Friday go-to is jeans (because I don't normally wear those M-TH) and a trendy sweater or blazer w/ men's type shirt under-- coordinating belt and accessories are a must for me no matter what day. Pair this with casual flats or boots. My Friday looks are less stuffy than my M-TH attire. I work in higher ed; it's not suits level attire M-TH, but managers on up shouldn't be wearing jeans during the week at my place of work. Friday is where I show a bit more of my personality. I never knew I had so much to say about casual Friday attire. lol	episode_done:True
text:What are your tips for being stylish when your weight fluctuates like crazy?	labels:Wrap dresses and wrap skirts tend to be flexible with size fluctuations. I don‚Äôt know if the same wrap skirt can take you from a size 4 to 14 but they‚Äôll fit longer than other styles do.

text:What's your fashion miracle?	labels:I used to wear small diamond earrings every day, and would put them in my wallet when I went to the gym after work. I got to work the next day and realized I forgot to put them back in after the gym, so I opened up my wallet and they were gone. I had made my usual morning stop for breakfast on the way to work, so I rushed to the food cart and looked all over the sidewalk but I couldn‚Äôt find them.  At least 1-2 weeks later I went to the same food cart for breakfast, looked down, and saw one diamond earring in the crack in the sidewalk. I looked more closely and there was the other one! The metal was chewed up (they were bezel set) so I had to get them repaired, but it was a lot cheaper than a new pair!   Definitely my #1 fashion (jewelry?) miracle.
text:I was on vacation with my parents and grandma when I noticed one of my ruby earrings was missing. It was probably one of the most expensive pieces of jewelry I owned and I was so upset and searched the hotel for days all over and couldn‚Äôt find it. One of the night my mom‚Äôs snoring was bugging me so much I decided to sleep in the bathroom and I put a towel down and was lying on the floor listening to music. It was like 3 am when I noticed something shiny. It was my earring in the tiniest crevices under the cabinet in literally a place where you had to be completely flat to see it so it was a pretty miraculous find.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What are your favourite ways to style a black leather moto jacket?	labels:People have already covered the dresses, but the dress/leather jacket combo is for sure one of my favorite ways to style them.

I love wearing it with a white top, light wash jeans, and my black leather combat boots (for me, doc martens but could be any boot with a similar color/texture to the jacket) bc i feel like a rocker from the 80s.

text:Suit Supply Review Times Two	labels:I‚Äôm going to agree with a couple of comments in here and say that the second experience at SuSu wasn‚Äôt *wrong*.  The outcome of getting a custom suit isn‚Äôt only contingent on what the client asks. Since a ‚Äúperfect‚Äù fit is a subjective concept, each custom fit is a confluence of not just the client‚Äôs requests, but also the individual preferences of the fitter and the standard cut of the brand. That is, it‚Äôs not just about where you go; it‚Äôs about who you work with when you get there.  I‚Äôm an associate for SuitSupply myself, and we all do a lot of custom. At the shop, each of the associates design custom suits a little differently. I almost always heighten the rise on the trousers, for example, and cut my chests really close. My coworker, on the other hand, always does a full leg taper and shortens the jacket a half centimeter. I‚Äôve had clients switch from me to someone else and vice versa for custom because they liked an individual‚Äôs fit better.  With all of those adjustment options at your disposal, it‚Äôs easy to get anxious if you‚Äôre not seeing them all getting used. Remember, though: if your suit doesn‚Äôt fit right, alterations and remakes are free, and the changes are noted so they can be added to the next suit you make. If you go back and let them know during the fitting about your prior experiences and how you want it to fit, or even bring in your original suit to guide the process.  I would give SuSu another chance. But I‚Äôm biased.	episode_done:True

It's summer, it's hot so you're wearing shorts, but the shorts are made from denim which is a hot and sweaty material. It's an oxymoron to me, like have you got your legs out to stay cool or have you got the denim on to stay warm? What's going on here?

text:What did you teach your mom about fashion?	labels:I taught my mom to have a little more fun, and to spoil herself. My mom has great style, but we live in the Midwest and looking at older photos of her I know later took on a sort of ‚Äúmom‚Äù approach to style-to put it nicely, she likes good clothes, but appreciates them on other people. I have lots of photos of her in the 80s with amazing hats, gloves, and other things that had so much presence. I work in fashion so my goal is always to nudge her a bit so that she can feel like the center of attention, but not so far as to make her uncomfortable. This means buying nice and ornate little accessories for her, or introducing her to trends she might not know are age appropriate and easy to find at a good price. Last year I got her a 3/4 length sleeve top in navy from Jcrew with little ostrich feathers on the sleeves, and it was understated enough that it allowed her to feel like a celebrity wearing it, and it seemed to suit her. It BLEW HER MIND! This year she asked for a red clutch, and was afraid it was too specific. I promised that I would search high and low to find something perfect. There is literally no place I won‚Äôt go to find something specific if she wants it, and I often know where to look and have my eyes open all year long. I want her to feel special because she is the only reason that I do.	episode_done:True
text:Thoughts on ski / apres ski style?	labels:Skiing is a strenuous sport, often done in a dangerous alpine climate. I wear technical gear: bright loose waterproof jacket and pants for visibility and mobility, wicking warm base layers, balaclavas and goggles to protect my eyes and skin, a helmet, and a backpack or fanny pack with an emergency kit.   After skiing, I strip off the outer layers and walk around in uggs, tights, and turtleneck.   You know what? I 100% blend in. I don't look better or worse than the hundreds of other people who have just come down from the mountain. This is why people specifically wear bright colors. Your party will be able to identify you at a distance from the specific colors you're wearing.   I think ski/apres ski style is to skiing what cottage core is to farming/homesteading. It's an aesthetic for people who don't actually do it.   If you like the look and aren't interested in skiing, then look into some New England heritage preppy looks. The bean boots, scandi wool sweaters, thick stretchy stirrup pants, fluffy trimmed accessories, and parkas may appeal to you. Uniqlo has some cute stuff in their recent collab that has that cozy lux vibe. Moncler and Gorsuch are some OG European ski fashion wear companies. You could look into those for inspiration.   But definitely don't try to go skiing without a waterproof pant and jacket combo. You will have a terrible time, given how much you will likely fall. (Assuming that you're a beginner.)

text:The Perspective of Medieval Menswear	labels:A few notes in regards to medieval clothing: Tabards were worn by a large mixture of people, but it is more of a coat (and yes, knights later on wore them over armour, there were also surcoats etc). What definitely was worn by all peasants was a tunic, worn over a shirt and braies (basically boxer shorts). Hose (leggings) were tied to the braies and were usually both brightly coloured and a different colour for each leg. There are more elaborate ones with multiple colours per leg, but that was for richer people. Over time tunics got shorter and braies became longer, until they became breeches. Crakows are a particular type of pointy shoe popular in the 15th century, the more general name is turnshoe, so named because they were made inside out, and then turned. In regards to Philip wearing black, interestingly this change was initially spearheaded more by the middle class. Previous black dyes were a more browny black, but in the 14th century a deeper black dye was developed and so many of the city-dwelling middle class (hence bourgeoisie) started wearing black, both as a sign of wealth at being able to afford this new dye and also because of certain other expensive colours being restricted. The nobility and royalty of Europe began picking this up soon after.

text:People who've been working from home for most of 2020 - do you think your work style will change when you go back to the office (compared to your work wardrobe pre-lockdown)? If so, how?	labels:I am a teacher that went back to working in the building at the beginning of September, so to be fair I was only wfh for several months in the spring, but it still drastically changed my style, or my perspective on my style.   Pre-Covid my work style (and general style) had morphed over the years to become very, very minimal and neutral. Lots of Everlane and Eileen Fisher. This was both because I wanted to be taken seriously at my job (I read very young) and because it also seemed like what was in style to me.   Returning to work in the fall, I realized I really f*cking hated all of my sensible, plain, go with everything black and grey clothes.   I still really prefer earth tones and blacks and greys, and I still wear some pretty simple outfits somedays, but I went on a small spree on The RealReal after I had my realization. I bought myself some louder statement pieces that feel more me, including an embroidered Happy Sheep sweater, a knit Missoni sheath dress, a multi-colored leather and fur purse, platform oxfords, and a couple of geometric patterned silk shirts and dresses.   For me life is too short to try so hard to be timeless and professional. I‚Äôm not knocking the look, it just isn‚Äôt ~me~ I want to love the clothes I wear and the clothes I love are fun knits and patterns.

text:Lower quality items during Nordstrom Anniversary Sale?	labels:Anecdotal, but here goes. I bought a pair of rag&bone jeans during Anniversary a couple years ago. They were thin and stretchy but I knew this going in so no problem. I liked them. I liked them well enough, in fact, to buy a second pair as a backup, which I've been known to do. The second pair, SAME cut AND wash was full-price after Anniversary. Thicker, not as stretchy, stitching was slightly different, felt "nicer" I guess, even though I had no complaints with the first pair. They were definitely different though, and purchased maybe a month apart.      Second, and this was this current year. Bought a couple Zella workout tees. Now, I've had numerous Zella pieces over the years and have never had an issue with washing and drying with regards to shrinking. This one shrunk on the first wash before I even had a chance to wear it, following the instructions to a T. The exact material blend was the same as my others. I will be returning this one when I get a chance.   I have no hard evidence either way, but I am suspicious. Also, as a longtime cardholder, every year Anniversary is more and more of a shitshow. There seems to be a huge amount of influencers (the blogger people, not the level of Nordstrom's rewards program) getting items that are never truly available to the public, even in the upper tiers of early access. It's all very frustrating and ultimately, not worth it for a retail sale. I'm not going to go full Karen and threaten to cancel my card or not shop there. I'm simply going to ignore Anniversary entirely from now on.	episode_done:True
text:Organizing Closet: Help!	labels:>	This system seems okay to me, but I don't really know how to differentiate each category based on function. For example, with the system I work with now, button-downs I wear in formal situations are currently grouped with tops I wear in informal situations AND workout-tops I wear for exercising. And this stresses me out so, so much. Then there's the issue of how effective my groupings are; like, should crop tops be with tank tops? Or maybe they're more like tees? And how do I deal with seasonal clothes?   You‚Äôre way overthinking it. You don‚Äôt have to be so strict about the categories or follow a plan to a T. Do what feels natural/right to you. If it doesn‚Äôt end up working, change it. It‚Äôs not set in stone.   1.	How do you mentally construct an outfit?  I would use those groupings because that‚Äôs what you already gravitate to. I personally sort by general type, then seasonality or formality. For example, my dresses/pants are split into formal (eg cocktail dress and up) and everything else. Within those subgroups, I sort by color.  Skirts are only sorted by color. Tops are split into sleeveless/short sleeved/long sleeved (3/4 sleeves go here), and those groups are subsorted by color.  Workout/swimwear/PJs/sweaters/underwear/socks/leggings/bras are their own categories that get dedicated drawer sections for their specific groups.  2.	Crop tops would be sorted by sleeves with other tops.  3.	worn but not dirty clothes go on a purposely dedicated row of hooks the wall (basically a fancy coat hook array that you might see in an entryway).  I‚Äôve done this since I was a child and recommend.	episode_done:True

text:I need help with getting rid of clothes	labels:Hi! As a stylist I get this question ALOT. For starters don't get rid of too much before buying replacements. What ends up happening is we get rid of everything without establishing what pieces we actually need.   Start with establishing your personal style. What do your want your closet/style to be? What do you want to look like on the day to day?   Next, set aside pieces that don't fit you well. If there is potential to have the piece tailored then get that done. Key here is to just set these pieces aside but dont get rid of them yet until you find a replacement just in case you HAVE to wear it again.   Lastly is shopping! Now that you have a moodboard and list of things you need you can shop to fin in the gaps and more importantly you can shop with intention!   &#x200B;  I hope that wasn't too much and was helpful haha. I'm always happy to help.
text:That's actually really helpful! How do you suggest finding my style? I feel like I have such a wide style that I wear (minimal, to punk, to cutesy, etc). I feel like I love all of my clothes but some go months without being worn.	labels:I think it‚Äôs fine to have multiple styles and even clothes you don‚Äôt wear that often. Maybe be more conscious in your purchases about how often you‚Äôll wear something but if you already own it and love it there‚Äôs no rush to get rid of it just because it‚Äôs not an everyday piece.	episode_done:True
text:FAQ: What are the different use cases of boat shoes, moccasins, driving shoes, and loafers?	labels:**Boat shoes**  \- On a boat, or trying to do more 'traditional' prep. No longer really worn by 'frats' in most of the country; they've all transitioned to sneakers.  \- Great for being out on the water when you don't care about them being wet. Never worn with socks.  **Moccasins**  \- more middle ground, depending on cut. Camp mocs have the same style purpose as boat shoes but are more practical away from water. I'll wear these to a bar, but never would with boat shoes because I'm no longer 19.  \-Blucher mocs to me are just 'casual' loafers  \- Proper moccasins are worn around the house  **Driving shoes**  \- driving, and not much else.  **Loafers**  \- most formal of the list. Can get you in and out of any situation, provided its not snowy; sloggy, or rainy. Going to look the best dressed up.- Here in the upper Midwest, I prefer a nice boot to loafers, but thats more 'modern' and can get looked down on by more traditionalists.     Also to add:   **Leather sneakers**   \- look great in more traditional colors and cuts (Tobacco, Black, Toffee etc)  \- are casual but a great idea if you dont want more formal shows	episode_done:True

text:What are your feelings on thrifting from ‚Äúproblematic‚Äù brands?	labels:The company already made money off of the original purchase of the shirt, so you buying second hand doesn‚Äôt really benefit them in any way. If you really want the item, buying it second hand is probably the most ethical choice you can make. If someone asks where the piece is from, just say you don‚Äôt know so they won‚Äôt be tempted to buy from the brand lol
text:But the second question is where to buy second hand from? For example near me we have the Salvation Army and a church thrift shop. I used to live next to a giant Salvation Army donation center and loved it, but after learning about their philosophy and some of the shady things they‚Äôve done I no longer feel like I can ethically support them! Then supporting the local church thrift is also problematic given their stances on social issues! When I lived in California I was able to find some thrift stores that actually gave to causes I support (out of the closet etc) but now that I‚Äôm in the Midwest there aren‚Äôt any of these! I just want like a thrift store that donates to something like education or food banks without the religious/social aspect.	labels:I've restarted to online stores because I have no thrift shops near me.

text:How have you been doing your shopping since Covid?	labels:I haven't been in a store in 7 months.  But it's not a sacrifice for me as I already vastly preferred online shopping (I like that I can comparison shop similar products across stores with the click of a button, and that I can jump on sales quickly).  I have a core 4 or 5 stores I shop at so I know my standard sizing there.  It's rare that I need to return an item...I order the size that I know, from past history, is very likely to fit.  And fortunately almost all of my core stores have easy free returns (except Uniqlo and their $10 online shipping return fee - boooooo).  It also helps that I like an oversized fit so if I've ordered slightly big, chances are I'll still like the fit.	episode_done:True

text:Thoughts on Shein?	labels:Controversial opinion, but, they aren‚Äôt that bad.   Let‚Äôs have some empathy for a moment: it is an absolute privilege to be able to shop at a sustainable store and/or to be able to buy secondhand. Imagine being someone who hasn‚Äôt bought new to them clothing in years because they can‚Äôt afford to and then fast fashion prices are waved in their faces on clothing that fits them and is their style. I‚Äôm not going to tell someone to not buy clothing from a place they can afford. I‚Äôm absolutely not doing it.   People demonize fast fashion because they look at it as black and white and don‚Äôt understand that, if you‚Äôre shopping at SHEIN, you likely can‚Äôt afford the more sustainable sources/you can‚Äôt find what you‚Äôre looking for secondhand. I‚Äôm plus sized. I can‚Äôt fit into and afford a lot of the sustainable brands out there. And, people buy out the ‚Äúfashionable‚Äù plus size items in my local thrift stores to sell on Depop, so, I don‚Äôt blame people for shopping on SHEIN.  I‚Äôve bought SHEIN secondhand and I‚Äôve had items for years and I haven‚Äôt had any issues. I haven‚Äôt bought first hand from them in a long time but when I did, I never had any long shipping times or anything, either. I found the same defects I‚Äôd find at Target, like, a long thread here or there that I can easily snip off.   This goes for fast fashion in general‚Äîif you take care of your clothes and wear the appropriate size, you can make them last. It‚Äôs not like they spontaneously rip apart, you have to do something to make them do that. Steam your clothes to get out wrinkle. Tumble dry, hand wash, etc.
text:You raise good points, but I‚Äôm going to respectfully disagree - I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs ever any valid excuse to buy from a company who openly profits from exploitative third world labour. We can all do better.   Sustainable fashion is expensive, yes. But *usually* buying quality clothing is cheaper in the long run than buying lots of cheap stuff (I know this is easier said than done for people living hand to mouth).   Secondly there are options that don‚Äôt exploit people. Namely second hand shops and Depop. I guarantee - no matter what the item is - someone‚Äôs already bought it or something VERY similar and wants to get rid of it. Even when I have money I buy from there because... why wouldn‚Äôt you?   The ‚Äúwhat about poor people‚Äù argument always gets made but it just doesn‚Äôt sit right with me. What about the people who are being paid 40p a day in sweltering and unsafe Bangladeshi factories? Factories that are dumping toxic dyes into water sources? We all have a responsibility not to perpetuate the monolithic success of these horrible fast fashion conglomerates.	labels:I guess if you haven't been on this situation it is hard to see.  For years I couldn't even spend 10‚Ç¨ on a t-shirt nor a jean more than once a year. Literally all my clothes were a few (or a lot) years old or given by the neighbors (so they fitted me badly or weren't to my liking but I was appreciative either way). Not only they were old, but they absolutely *looked* old.  So yes, when I discovered Aliexpress, I did some shopping there. Not a lot, but at least I could finally get some new shoes and pullovers and not look miserable anymore. I could finally buy panties and some bras (even though I never found any bra that fits). Now that I can afford it, I try to be more sustainable with my shopping decisions, but until two years ago, it was impossible.  Also, higher prices doesn't necessarily mean more sustainable. Fast fashion is everywhere and I kid you not, I bought a pullover on Aliexpress that had a Zara tag and a few weeks after receiving it, this same pullover was sold on Zara for thrice the price. Even self-proclaimed sustainable brands have done some shit in their production.  Some people can't spend more money on clothing. If you can afford it, yes, try to avoid fast fashion as much as possible, but let's understand that this is a privilege not everybody can afford.
text:You can buy second hand clothing, often with the tags still on, for even cheaper than in the shops. I use the app Vinted (I‚Äòm in Germany) and it is literally bursting with H&M, Shein, Zara, and a zillion other fast fashion brands for dirt cheap. I see people selling brand new or almost brand new clothing for as little as 2 to 3 euros. You don‚Äôt have to avoid fast fashion, just don‚Äôt buy it from the shop because that will just drive production.   In 2021 though there really isn‚Äôt an argument in favor of buying new fast fashion. We know how shitty the industry is. Second hand clothing is BEYOND accessible with the help of the internet and the apps are literally exploding with clothing that people are trying to sell. Trying to defend these fashion empires who are running our planet into the ground and exploiting millions upon millions of people in the name of poor people is really unfair. That argument held water before literally everyone had a smart phone, but not now. Besides, as has already been pointed out, those aren‚Äôt the people driving the fast fashion industry. They aren‚Äôt making literal billions in profits every year from people buying a couple of shirts or jeans once a year.  I will probably get downvoted because this sub has a severe aversion to calling out fast fashion, but whatever.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:What's on your 2021 fashion wishlist?	labels:I'm going from the Middle East (last year) to living in the Baltics (2021) so it's going to be aaaaall about the cold-weather gear and woolens for me. I don't have a super-great grasp on what the formality levels are going to be at work yet, but I'm definitely hoping to get some great all-weather boots, some super warm leggings for non-work or work from home wear. The new job comes with a promotion so I'm going to need a few suits and some wool dress slacks for work (for those days when it's just too cold for anything else!).  I'm thinking a lot about velvet and knit and texture, trying to do longer (and warmer!) skirts than my usual pencil skirt without looking girlish or dowdy... and trying not to splurge on every coat known to man (four wool coats and a cape isn't too-too much, right?)
text:Depending on where you are in the Baltic, I'd encourage you to look into local artisan's fibercrafts, especially for accessories. There's a rich knitting and yarn crafting history there, and some of the work can be very delicate and beautiful.   For extra cold days, I'd recommend silk thermal undergarments. The silk should keep you warm, and any wool trousers from getting too static-y.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Can you build a wardrobe off Amazon?	labels:A huge chunk of my wardrobe is built out from Amazon. I add everything to a list, and wait until Amazon's algorithms decide they need to sell it for $6. They also offer Tall sizes on quite a lot of items, which is great for having sleeves that fit.  Uniqlo for jeans, Amazon's Peak Velocity brand for Tshirts, and Goodthreads for everything else is what I would do if I had to start from Scratch.  If there's a certain type of item your looking for, feel free to ask for recommendations and I can send you a link to what I'd look at.
text:Thanks for sharing!   Items I'm looking for:  \- White sneakers - preferably leather   \- Jeans - Slim/skinny light blue, navy, black   \- Jackets - from bomber jackets to other non-bomber kinds  \- Sweaters or sweatshirts I can layer under my jacket  \- Long sleeve shirts/henleys  \- boots   If you've come across any of these on amazon that you think may be decent purchase I'd love to check it out	labels:White Sneakers - Stan Smiths. Watch FrugalMaleFashion, got mine for $40  Jeans- Uniqlo is the best bang for the buck imo. Their selvedge lines are much more durable than Levis to me  Jackets - Check out Goodthreads. I got a french terry hoodie & bomber that i'm pretty impressed with for under $20 each  Henleys: Check out the Peak Velocity athletic henley.  Boots - I don't think you're going to find anything too great below $100. You can grab some Golden Fox boots, but i'd rather save up the extra $75 and get Iron Rangers seconds from Sierra Trading Post or elsewhere.  &#x200B;  I'd recommend poking around some sites like Dappered, or Primer.

You don't have to spend a fortune on new clothes (target is fine).  Women do not tend to wear khakis down here.  Loose linen pants would probably feel good though.  Colors will be brighter, bring sunglasses.  New Orleans will be a swamp most of the year, so whatever you would pack for a beach vacation.  You don't need snow anything (shoes, coat), maybe a light jacket for the colder months.  I didn't use my wool coat for a couple years, it wasn't cold enough.  You could probably get away with a wool sweater and layers under if it dips to the 30s and you're still acclimated to cold weather.  Yes to a light cotton or linen cardigan for the AC.  Do not underestimate the heat and humidity.	episode_done:True
text:General Discussion - November 12, 2020	labels:I ordered a new saddle for my bike.  Immediately after ordering, I saw a promotion for 15% off my first order.

text:Is fast fashion really fast fashion if you get years of use out of the garments?	labels:r/zerowaste has had discussions on the topic. So has r/frugal I guess and there are a few other subs. I don't think there is a fixed rule. The world is changing too fast for that.  Maybe the key is to scale down spending, thrift as much as possible and be critical when shopping. Price does not necessarily equals quality.    The way I see it, high-end brands are just expensive. Nowadays luxury brands seem to be as mass-produced as anything else. Profit above all.  I also have realized that brand loyalty in the 21st century might have become a bit silly. I have trusted brands in the past but it seems pointless now, bc even sizing can change randomly.  Maybe customers shd spend more carefully. Buy what is needed, make sure what you are getting is looking good on you, it looks well-made and it feels nice on your skin. It is better to have fewer garments that make you look superb than many trashy pieces that will not do you any justice. Every person has their beauty, we shd only have and wear what makes us look fabulous.  My two cents	episode_done:True

Almost worst: Off yellow Ivy Trad collegiate Vneck sweater. I thought my fall wardrobe had more things to match with it, and then I pulled out my fall wardrobe and found nothing that I would have wanted to wear with it.

I looked down at my crappy nylons and actually felt cheap. I went to Nordtroms that night and bought presentable nylons and wore them to work the next day. She nodded in approvement and then told me no one would take me seriously as long as I wore cheap sweaters. I then bought a wildly pretty ivory cable knit sweater and wore it to work and feeling quite exactly like 1000000 bucks AND i had fancy nylons too. She told me no one would take me seriously with my unkempt shoes and that's when I learned the power of a shoe shining kit.  The next day I wore crappy slacks...and, well you know how the story goes.  To this very day I wear natty clothes and shoes so shiney they can blind fleet of Greek warriors.  The only real irony is no one gave a tootie about nylons and yet I still wear them despite all evidence to the contrary....and she threw al hers away after our company got bought out by another and they were no longer required.

text:Does AGE really effect your choice of Fashion - Clothing Trends (Discussion)	labels:Honestly, I can tell you are still young (mid-20s) from the nature of the question. It depends on lifestyle much more than age. Plenty of 40 and even 50-somethings wear trendy non-conservative clothing especially in creative or tech industries, while plenty of 20-somethings dress like dads because they have more corporate jobs. But as you get older, you do shift brands a bit. For example, currently, 20-somethings might still desire streetwear brands like Supreme, Vetements, and Yeezys while those older might still be hip but shifted to Fear of God, Balenciaga, CDG or more upscale brands that still have a casual street vibe.

text:Tips for easily looking more modern/in style?	labels:I would recommend updating your "fashion basics" like plain t-shirts and jeans first because then more unique pieces will just look unique, not outdated. For instance, consider a black t-shirt with jeans. Ten ish years ago you might have a vneck tshirt and boot cut mid wash jeans, five years ago probably skinny jeans in a darker wash and a slim crew neck, and now maybe a square neck bodysuit with light wash straight jeans. But on the other hand if you have some kind of, I don't know, cool bomber jacket, it doesn't really look out of date especially because thrifting is in right now.	episode_done:True

text:General Discussion - November 30, 2020	labels:<rant>  If I said "Wear cropped jackets so you look taller" I'd be laughed out of the room but somehow "Short people shouldn't wear long coats" is a valid thing?   Also what's defined as short? If someone is 5'7" do they get to wear long coats? What if they're 5'7.5"??  It also throws the idea out the window of the whole horizontal breaks thing that people complain about for cropped trousers or high-waisted pants. Suddenly you have a wonderful garment type that can give you long, **tall**, and elegant lines and it's impossible to wear.   People complain all the damn time about menswear being too "restrictive" and women's wear being more "exciting" but everyone is too much of a wimp to wear a ~ L O N G C O A T ~.  I fucking hate fashion "rules" and "guidelines" and literally everything having to do with the word "flattering". If you care so much about these gender norms, masculinity and being ~ flattering ~ then sack up and wear the clothes you like.   That whole thread is just people saying that someone else told them they couldn't *wear a coat* so what should they do? Oh idk. How about tell them to fuck off and wear the damn coat.  </rant>

text:Purses: Real vs. Faux Leather?	labels:I can‚Äôt stand faux leather. Not for shoes, bags, clothes; anything. Plastic can start to degrade after some time (6-10 years). I had some faux leather hiking boots that turned to mush just sitting in their box in my closet. The handles on faux leather purses start to peel and the bottoms wear very fast. They simply do not hold up like leather.  I have vintage Dooney&Bourke leather bags that are 25+ years old. I keep them polished, clean and in dust bags when not in use and they look new.  If you can afford a genuine leather bag, even secondhand, it is the best choice imo.
text:I have had mostly leather ( good quality) bags over my lifetime.  They usually last about 6 years or more of daily wear before they are worn enough to replace, or another workhorse bag catches my eye.  If you like to change bags with outfits, or seasonal, I prefer relatively inexpensive ones to fill in, like straw, cloth, novelty.  I keep those under $20-$30 range.  One way to pay less for good quality are thrift stores un upscale areas.  My last bag cost $30 and was retail $600 Italian leather.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:How do you actually incorporate colour in your wardrobe?	labels:As someone who used to exclusively wear black (not exaggerating, it was a manifestation an anxiety/ocd problem- lots of therapy, baby steps, and now I consider leopard and hot pink neutrals), I found it easiest to start with accessories (especially shoes!) and patterns that were mostly black. Dark florals go with just about everything. Once I got used to that, I branched out into floral pants and funky sweaters. There was definitely trial and error, and I spent a ton of money on items that ultimately went to consignment it goodwill. However, now I have a really good idea of what I like, and while I still love a good neutral moment, my wardrobe is probably 1/2 colorful pieces, 1/4 non-black neutrals, and 1/4 black pieces.	episode_done:True
text:Can you have a clothing style without actually wearing that certain style much?	labels:I think if you find a style appealing but don't actually wear it, it's not technically your style. Like I really appreciate romantic styles with volume, lace, ruffles, drama, etc but I rare wear clothes that could be described as romantic because it doesn't feel appropriate for work. I wouldn't describe my style as romantic, despite window shopping on the Oscar de la Renta site a lot.   But! I also don't really put a lot of thought into what my style is or what I think it is - I wear what makes me happy. While I do find value in expressing my personality in clothes, I try not to get too caught up in what it means or this mindset that if my style changes, who I am as a person changes.  I think your situation is different because you live at home and don't have quite as much freedom to choose what you can wear, so that gets a pass. It's quite possible that if you had the ability and freedom to wear what you wanted, you'd wear more alternative clothing.	episode_done:True
text:Can you build a wardrobe off Amazon?	labels:I‚Äôd doubt that Amazon offers enough quality pieces to really redo your wardrobe.

I‚Äôm not advocating for buying overpriced pieces either, just simply stating that just because you may be able to buy a ‚Äúcomplete wardrobe‚Äù off Amazon you may be very disappointed in your choices if your wardrobe is shot by the time you‚Äôre 23.  Good quality clothes can last forever, and the money you spend will stretch further.	episode_done:True

text:Sewing your own clothes	labels:Definitely worth the time! Aside from producing clothes that you want and that fit you, you are developing transferable skills like manual dexterity, decision-making and problem-solving.   Not sure what you mean by lounge clothes, but if you mean clothing made from stretch jersey, you need either a machine that does zig zag stitch or (ideally) an overlocker machine. If you try to sew stretch fabrics with a standard stitch, you will either end up with puckering or a garment that doesn't stretch at the seams, or more likely both. If you have the right machine, it is no harder than sewing woven fabrics once you get the hang of it.
text:My mother has an overlock, I tried once and it is not easy, but I am going to persevere. I am having hard time finding some fabrics, though. Is it only possible to find jersey? I wanted to buy fabric to sew sweatpants and hoodies (I know it sounds weird). Do you think it is possible?	labels:Joanne fabrics has an extensive selection online
text:That's great! Thank you :)	labels:I always used polyester when I started out. It‚Äôs cheaper and it‚Äôs durable and it doesn‚Äôt fade or shrink. Wash your fabrics before cutting and sewing regardless tho!

text:How do you balance bright statement pieces with a capsule wardrobe?	labels:Its ok if a strict capsule doesn't work for you. Everyone's capsule can be different. You could have a secondary casule for your bright stuff to mix and match if you want! It's all about what works for you.
text:And that may very well be. My idea for wanting to set up a capsule wardrobe was because in the last 5 years, I've moved 7 times, so I'm trying to keep my clothing as little as possible. With a capsule wardrobe, I can have, say, 20-30 pieces and 50+ outfits with them instead of having 20-30 pieces of non-matching color schemes and having maybe 20 outfits.	labels:One more thing, if you can narrow your colors a little, it helps with cohesiveness. Like 1-2 neutrals and 2-3 colors for everything else. You still get some color, but there are a few limits. I have a rule that all my patterns need to have at least one of my colors in it. The primary color should be one of my neutrals or one of my colors, and then it can have anything else after that! If it is a pattern that prioritizes my neutral, then it also needs one of the actual colors too. In my world, that means, if I get a floral item with black, then it should have some pink. It can't be only blues, reds. and greens.
text:Ooo, I like your idea about the prints having a color in your color scheme! That‚Äôs something I‚Äôve never thought of but I like the idea of. I have to go check my dresses now to see how close I am! :)	labels:It makes it easier for me to say no to items as well. :P I have tried multiple times to make navy and white dresses work in my wardrobe and they never get worn. Now they are banned!	episode_done:True
text:What Did You Recently Get Rid of From Your Closet (and How, Please Help Me Help Myself)	labels:I once got the tip to put everything in your closet with the open part of your hanger hook facing out. Then, when you wear something, turn that hanger the right side out (i.e. round side of the hook facing out). Set a time period that you want to revisit cleaning your closet (i.e. a season/year etc) and after that time period donate or throw out everything that still has the hook turned in. Similarly, pack all the things you aren't sure if you want to keep into a box and set a time frame. If you find yourself wanting to wear something in that box, take it out. At the end of the time-frame, donate what's still there (especially if you forgot that item existed).  Recently due to COVID, I moved across back the country so I had to fit my closet into suitcases. That involved donating a lot of things that are perfectly nice and wearable but what I had to admit to myself that 1)I actually never wore in the 3 years I lived there and 2) didn't miss in the few months that I was living without them (I was living out of a carry on when I got unexpectedly stuck back home).  In terms of the never throw anything out, perhaps donate it to  a charity that's helps dress the less fortunate for work? They're definitely pieces that others will love.

text:[Serious answers only] FAQ: Why does runway fashion looks like nothing you'd ordinarily wear on the daily?	labels:The best response I‚Äôve ever heard for this question was comparing runway high fashion to the concept cars you‚Äôll see at auto shows. Those cars will often never make it into production but that‚Äôs not the point. The point is to show off new materials, technologies, design philosophies or to generally stir up interest in a brand. Same for fashion.

text:Do you have a concept of "Par Value" in menswear?	labels:What can help with defining on par is a cost per use / year metric. Especially, if you set yourself a price you are willing to pay for an item per year and use that as the measure of on par quality or not.   As an example, my Barbour wax jacket cost 350 back in the day, it gets a new finish every three years which is around 30ish. So over a period of 20 years that jacket costs me roughly 550. hence, on a yearly basis I paid 27.50 which is fine by me. However, if it had lasted only five years I would have probably seen it differently (and if it had gone to pieces after one year I would have been livid).
text:Well, but different things last different people different lengths of time, so it's hard to guess at value in advance that way.  And then... maybe you like the way your denim ages over time, but hate the way your dress shoes age over time. Or maybe you like the way your C&J chukkas ripple over decades but still look sleek and clean with proper care, but you hate the way your suede cdbs with crepe soles look after a year of wear. The CDBs are still wearable, they still "last," but you just don't get the same enjoyment out of them at that point.  Or maybe you get a rolex, and sell it four years later at the same price you bought it for... which is terrible, from an investment perspective, so you can do some math to see what you really lost, and compare that to the price of just getting a cheap tissot every few years, and compare the pleasure you get from those options.  There are a thousand ways to complicate the math, but it's really only serving to give you persepctive.	labels:Agree. I think you just need a program that works for you. I like to look at value per year (use is similar across items I have) but somebody else might look for something completely different.	episode_done:True
text:People who've been working from home for most of 2020 - do you think your work style will change when you go back to the office (compared to your work wardrobe pre-lockdown)?

I miss going to the office and feeling cute, and being seen by others. A woman I work with told me ‚Äòyou always have the cutest dresses‚Äô about a year ago and I absolutely loved hearing that. I‚Äôve learned in quarantine that I don‚Äôt dress for myself, I dress for other people.   I‚Äôll probably dress up a bit more when I can go back and wear more lipstick, since I‚Äôve been in comfy slouch mode for so long.
text:I‚Äôm exactly the same. I had a Rent the Runway unlimited membership that I used mainly for playing around with my work style.

text:How do your clothes wear out?	labels:For me, it‚Äôs typically the elasticity of fabrics start to give and the items no longer fit correctly or if it‚Äôs a bottom, they no longer ‚Äústay up‚Äù. This usually happens with leggings or panties after about 5 or more years of regular wear with caring for the items properly.  I also had a faux leather jacket wear out after 6 years of regular wear. The faux leather ended up ‚Äúpeeling off‚Äù or something like that.
text:I just had a jacket peel like that. I'm bummed bc it was one of my favorites. I'd like to try and stop the peeling if I can so I've been hanging on to it and not wearing it!	labels:Honestly there's no way to really stop the peeling short of sewing a patch over the entire affected area so nothing rubs against it (I've had a lot of jackets/pants that did that and nothing seems to work).

text:How have you been doing your shopping since Covid?	labels:I generally hate shopping online, but I have been. If possible, I'll order 2 sizes for items and return what doesn't fit. Ideally I like to return in store, but I have found a lot of the stores near me have closed this year so that is a more annoying option.  I also hate that so few brands include shipping labels, I do not have printer so that means I need to go to Fedex to print, and then drop off at UPS or postoffice. It is annoying (printing at UPS is too expensive).

text:Changing your mindset from fast fashion to one of investment pieces. What did you learn?	labels:Having gone through this transition, the main advice I would give you is to understand the categories and "slots" in your wardrobe before you shop for pieces, and if you have an item-type you like while you wish the piece were better in a particular way, upgrade that piece specifically, and take your time doing so.  For example: I learned I love well-fitted, thin turtlenecks with structured trousers and skirts, so now I feel secure shopping for high-end turtlenecks. But I also know I only have 4 "slots" in my closet for these - one black, one gray, one taupe/camel, one cream - so that's all I need, forever, and I can upgrade one piece at a time. I'm giving myself permission to wear the same things all the time, like a cartoon character, while I do so. :)	episode_done:True

A good tailor, a good cobbler (even for non-stitched footwear), and creativity to upcycle, repair, etc. is important.   While I think the blame for sustainability falls squarely on the duty of brands and governments to enforce it's not something that's economically sustainable under capitalism. Something something no ethical consumption something something.
text:Big problem is sourcing stuff. I mostly buy used on ebay, but if I wanna shop used in person my choices are:  1. Company that hates the lgbt community  2.

text:How has your style and shopping habits changed with age and financial standing?	labels:Significantly.

text:How much was your most expensive fashion item and when or how often do you wear it?	labels:My most expensive items are my Native American Turquoise jewelry and my cowboy boots. Just purchased a huge $900 squash blossom necklace and have worn it constantly. My boots range from $30 for a secondhand pair to $750 for custom made and none are worn more or less than the others.  When my mother passed, she was 88. I went to clean out her closet and drawers and found so many lovely things that were carefully boxed away or wrapped in tissue that she was ‚Äúsaving for good‚Äù. Ironically, ‚Äúgood‚Äù apparently never came as these things went unused.  I decided right then to never do that. Every day is special and I am worth taking the time to look and feel special even if I‚Äôm just out running errands.

text:Dressing larger bodies - without looking sloppy	labels:I think what's consistent in the examples that you've shown is that she has a very minimalist style in darker colors. The quality of the fabric appears to be high. When you use natural fibers like cotton and wool and silk they will naturally drape better on any body type. Look for pieces like cocoon jackets, cropped wide leg trousers, and tunics for example. I hope this helps, I love the images you've selected. last thought is that if you are going to accessorize keep it somewhat simple and also high quality.	episode_done:True

text:How do you know when something doesn't fit perfectly?	labels:The most basic thing, fundamental, objective thing is if it uncomfortable or impedes your movements. Some of this you only figure out when you wear things particularly if they are too loose (too tight you usually notice faster), like tops or dresses too big their neckline might move a bit and look askew, or you step on the hem of skirts or dresses at you climb stairs. Skirts too tight might ride up, pants too tight might dig and create camel toe or the zipper give way and open...  For other things, say pant or skirt length it might be a matter of aesthetics, 5 or 10 cm lower or higher..  Probably the most important point for things to fit is the shoulders and armpits, so it does not impede movement and because outerwear, tops, etc, hangs literally from there. If fitted, the seam should be at the edge of your shoulder blade naturally.  Not everything can be altered to fit right. There might not be enough fabric for that, or it might just a design which was cut for different proportions than yours. Tailoring can do subtle tweaks, on woven fabrics (knits are harder, way harder), but the first and most important step of getting clothes which fit well is REJECTING things, lots of things, most things, almost all things. Trying many many things, being analytical so you can learn stuff (if it looks like that chances are it will loook  this other thing on my body, Brand X pants always fit me right and Brand Y pants never).

I live in Japan, where it rains pretty frequently, so I'm thinking of trying out techwear as a way to stay stylish on those rainy days. Can anyone recommend some cheaper tapered cargo pants and hardshells/jackets for a beginner to try out the look? No solid price range, but obviously I can't afford acronym or anything crazy like that. Only requirement besides style is that it still has to be functional enough to actually wear in pretty heavy rain.	episode_done:True

text:Is the high fashion industry a little tone-deaf for F/W 2020?	labels:Why would it be tonedeaf? This is kind of a U.S.-centric view. Not everyone in the world is still struggling with COVID, and a lot of the rest of the world isn't nearly as casual as America is, fashion-wise.   Call me crazy, but I'm tired of shapeless billowy clothing in earth tones, and I am READY for some structure and interesting textures. All summer has been about beige and washed out green and brown linen, let's see something else.   Plus, it's a weird take anyway, because high fashion doesn't really target loungewear, either way. Do we really expect major fashion houses to all abandon blazers and leather pants and start showing PJs and sweatpants on the runway?   Others have already pointed out that these collections have been designed months in advance, but consider another point - fashion has always been reactive. When forced to stay inside and only wear sweatpants for 6 months, people will rebel and start daydreaming and longing for the opposite. This pandemic was always going to inspire a sort of glam rock aesthetic, imo. BRING IT.

I've found it's a really useful skill too (obviously), feels nice to hype people up.

text:If you could get yourself one fashion gift, what would it be?	labels:I'd get a really nice piece of outerwear, either a coat in a quality material like wool or a leather or shearling jacket. If you live somewhere with colder weather during part of the year, outerwear is something you'll be wearing all the time so it's worth investing in a piece that's great quality, keeps you warm and makes a statement. I think an amazing jacket or coat will elevate even the most basic outfit, whether it's a more classic piece, something utilitarian like a puffer jacket or something more extravagant. Personally I think Acne, Chloe and Tibi are brands that make great high-end outerwear in a variety of styles.

text:No. But you don‚Äôt actually need to be at max comfort every second of every day, most clothing out there isn‚Äôt really uncomfortable, but if your baseline is ‚Äújust as comfortable as sweats‚Äù you aren‚Äôt gonna find anything.

I wash my jeans every 5-8 wears same as other pants because all of mine bag out regardless. Sweaters I usually handwash every 1-2 years lol. Leather stuff I try to condition at least once a year (my favourite shoes get more love).   It helps a lot that I‚Äôm not very sweaty or smelly (confirmed by outside sources).	episode_done:True

Some of the back cutouts are cool though.  I strongly prefer cleaner lines and more sculptural silhouettes as opposed to the poofy, frilly silhouettes happening here. I wish prints were trendier though! I like the silhouettes of the more minimalist dresses, but the colors are soooo boring.

Also from LL Bean I their 3 in one jacket which I love (it's a raincoat and fleece that you can wear together or separate, depending on the weather). The fleece is kind of similar to Patagonia's better sweater (I think it's called that?).

I haven‚Äôt lived anywhere near one in a very long time but really want to try some of their sweaters.	labels:I feel like they run pretty TTS...I do have a tendency to size up because of my bigger bust and I like things on the roomier size, and have found that sizing up to an XL from L provided that.

text:Discussion: LGBTQIA+ Signaling, Presentation, and Commodification in Fashion	labels:These are the two questions that interest me most, so:   *What does queer fashion mean to you?*    Queer fashion is whatever a person who identifies as Queer identifies as their way of approaching clothes/self expression.  I'm reminded of a Hannah Gadsby quote, where she talks about someone complaining there wasn't enough "lesbian content" in her comedy, to which her reply was "I was on the stage the whole time."  I feel like defining something as "Queer" can be a little...exclusionary, especially when it's used to exclude others. "Oh, you don't dress "gay". Well, ok.  *Bonus question for LGBTQIA+ folks - do you feel pressure to present a certain way based on wanting to signal to others or what the media has stereotyped a certain group to present like?*    Yes, but usually by other LGBTQIA+ folks. The rise of social media has been great because a lot of people feel more comfortable expressing their identities...but it seems like there's this assumed homogenity which has got even stronger (I'm not even that old, but predate social media by a good few years).  I am all for expressing identity! I love that LGBTQIA+ people feel they can do that!    But " are you ever gay if..." shit makes me tired.  Media has stereotyped us enough. Let's not do it to myself. Caveat: I could just be salty that I look bad in cuffed jeans :P	episode_done:True

text:How often do you wash your clothes?	labels:Same, I only spot wash when something has stains and machine wash if something smells, otherwise I'll keep wearing it even if it's been a long time since the last wash. One thing I do often though, is air clothes out, even if they don't smell, specially if it's clothes that touch my skin directly, like tshirts and tight fitting knits etc, these items might seem clean and free of smells but if left in the wardrobe for a long time, will start to smell, airing them extends the freshness.  The only exception is pants and socks, they are washed after every use.	episode_done:True
text:How does your makeup style and clothing style relate? - discussion	labels:I like to coordinate makeup with outfits or wear makeup that doesn‚Äôt match, but that compliments my outfit . I love makeup, especially lipstick so much. If I‚Äôm wearing a red dress generally I‚Äôll also wear a red lip. I have a mustard yellow dress that I think looks amazing with an orangey-red lipstick I have. I have a light lavender/lilac coloured dress that I like to wear a plumb lipstick with or a lilac coloured eyeshadow. If I‚Äôm going for a more neutral look I do beige or pink eyeshadow and a nude lipstick. I also think white tops and dresses look really good with red or bright pink lipstick.	episode_done:True
text:Rick Owens Wearing Rick Owens	labels:I don't own a single piece of his clothing, and I probably never will, but one of the quotes attributed to him that really stuck with me when I first started browsing mfa was "No outfit is going to make you look or feel as good as having a fit body. Buy less clothing and go to the gym instead." He was right.
text:That's probably the single most recognizable quote of his outside diehard avant-garde fashion circles. It needs some contextualizing though. Like everything else, you have to consider where the speaker is coming from. Rick is addicted to working out. He's on steroids. His addiction is understandable because before he got into working out he was doing drugs and was, by his own admission, on a very unhealthy path. His wife got him into working out instead. But he's effectively swapped one addiction for another. Working out is generally one of the best things you can do for your health, but not when you're pushing 60 and regularly taking steroids. When it comes to that Rick quote, it's worth knowing that he's not speaking from a well-balanced position.  All that is to say, the general spirit of the quote is solid advice. But Rick Owens is probably not a good authority on moderation, which as with all activities, should be a part of your workout routine.	labels:I really appreciate you offering this perspective and context	episode_done:True
text:Best and Worst Purchases of 2020?	labels:**Best:** Outlier Ramielight Camp Collar in Dark Forest. Such a great shirt that I ended up buying a second one in white. My favorite thing to wear outside this summer whenever I did go out.  **Worst:** Beckett Simonon Morgen all white sneakers. Note, this is my second pair, and this time I decided to go with the all whites instead of re-upping on the gum sole. It's not that I don't like this, it's a combination of not a lot of clothes purchases this year (which has been great) while also not loving them as much as the gum soles. I still have my gum soles and I almost pulled the trigger on another pair this week since they had seconds on sale for $89.	episode_done:True

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - January 20, 2021	labels:I was recently awarded a 40 Under 40 award by a regional magazine. Part of the award includes a photoshoot to be printed in said magazine.   I'm a creative director for a living, I work in an environment that prides itself on comfortable dress. I have tailored suits, I know how to put together a nice outfit. However, I'd like to do something a bit different for this shoot. The suit is obvious, it's expected. How can I switch it up? Show off some more creativity in patterns, materials, or unexpected pieces.
text:I‚Äôd probably do   - unstructured sport coat with pattern or texture in something like dark burgundy or deeper green as an alternative to blue - shirt, pick what color you want - wool pants with some more texture or pattern, eg. a chalk stripe flannel or something. I think a medium gray would be the move here and would pair well with just about any jacket.  - tie and pocket square optional, I probably wouldn‚Äôt as it could come across as stuffy. Could do a square with no tie. - shoes id keep *slightly* more casual; maybe a chelsea boot or a penny loafer or something. You‚Äôre a creative director so show some creativity.  If you want some inspiration look at stuff like Drake‚Äôs, Boglioli, or Eleventy.  It would not hurt to bring two jackets, or if you decide to wear a tie, two ties, to the shoot in case one photographs drastically better.   Look a little creative but don‚Äôt add a bunch of accessories so it doesn‚Äôt look like you‚Äôre trying too hard.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:How to combine colors	labels:To be honest, a lot of these resources read like the kind of infographics MFA used to upvote; there's the trifecta of pseudo-objective diagrams (e.g. color wheels), dubious pop-psychology (e.g. colors' subconscious associations), and simple but misleading theory (e.g. "seasonal" color schemes) for lurkers looking for 'rules' to bind them.  And like those infographics, I feel that most of these are, at best, an attempt to transform the act of "looking at things and using your brain" into tractable but useless theory (compare: any time someone tries to create a head-shape matrix for glasses), and at worst pretty much junk (particularly the psychology bits). They're also usually based on the fucky assumption that a conventional white American beauty standard is objectively "correct."  Prevailing trends and cultural/subcultural context are way more meaningful determinants of how to use color than a set of temporally/culturally specific rules, and frankly I think the only way to understand those is experience: looking, doing, and thinking. "Caucasians shouldn't wear all black because it offsets their undertone and makes their skin look less vibrant," for instance, sounds reasonable up till you look at actual people who look perfectly fine in it.	episode_done:True

text:Bags that are actually beautiful - what are you loving?	labels:I'm definitely not a bag person either, I'm either out with my fanny pack worn cross-body or wear a small (or big) backpack. But, Telfar bags just do something to me. I love their sleek yet interesting design, the fact that they have many sizes, and they seem pretty practical if you're a bag person. When I'm older and have more money and reasons to wear a bag, maybe I'll own one.
text:My biggest problem with Telfar is that there isn‚Äôt a size between the small and medium bags. The size difference is massive. I‚Äôm not used to carrying around larger bags so the medium is way too big, but the small is so tiny I can only fit my iPhone, sanitizer and a credit card in it.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:How do I feel more comfortable "dressing up"?	labels:Try to see things from their perspective. *You* know that this is your real sense of style, and you have liked these clothes for a long time, but to your friends and family, you are a person that wears a t-shirt and jeans. So when you wear a skirt, that's very different and out of character for you. You just need to grind through the first few times, and then they will expect you to dress like that and they won't say anything.  And yes, "because I felt like it" is a good enough answer. Did someone tell you it wasn't? They're wrong.

text:What is your favorite clothing/accessories subscription box?	labels:Is your main goal of using a subscription service to save time shopping or because you need help with picking the clothes?  For me it would be to save time shopping because I love picking my own clothes, but I have always felt that the inventory with the subscription services is too narrow.  Another reason I have shied away from subscription services like Stitch Fix is trust.  I don't trust that they aren't sending the inventory they are trying to get rid of before they bring new inventory in.  I like to use a platform where people save their favorites and I can shop from what they have saved!
text:It‚Äôs definitely that I need helping choosing clothing! I have always enjoyed shopping but it is usually difficult for me to find clothing that fits my body type and style.

text:Colour/Style Matching - How do I figure out the potential of my wardrobe?	labels:1) The most foolproof way is to try on every combination of clothing possible. Especially the things that you‚Äôre like - there‚Äôs no way that will work. Because that‚Äôs how you discover new combinations. Or you‚Äôre like... well, that didn‚Äôt work but if the top were like slightly longer, it‚Äôd actually be amazing - and that‚Äôs a great way to build a shopping list of stuff that would work with what you already have.   2) Trying on clothes is actually a lot of work. If you‚Äôre lazy and would rather lie around instead (cough what do you mean, I‚Äôm not talking about myself at all), if you put all your clothes in a closet app (I use Stylebook) you can look at what‚Äôs in your closet on your phone and make up different combinations to try out later. This isn‚Äôt foolproof, you will need to still try them on irl to see if they actually work (although the more practice you get the better you‚Äôll get at creating successful outfits). Actually getting all your clothes in a closet app is a whole lot of work to start tbh, but if you want to go that route I find it‚Äôs best to use as many stock photos as possible and don‚Äôt bother with background removal.   3) If you really want to be a geek and see everything in your closet laid out, do a visual wardrobe. People posted them occasionally a couple years ago so search the sub if you want to see examples - but you basically take a picture of yourself wearing every piece of clothing you own. This takes a long time but you have the advantage of being able to see what your clothes look like on you and I feel like that makes it easier to pick out good outfit combos, because at least to me, silhouette is so important. Also it‚Äôs kind of fun to see what types of clothes you gravitate towards and you can sometimes discover things like ‚ÄúI really need a bright yellow jacket, that would tie together so many of these outfits‚Äù or ‚ÄúI actually hate green so why do I own 24 green t-shirts???‚Äù that‚Äôs kind of hard to parse when all your clothes are tucked away in drawers and stuff.

For that you can also "randomize" your outfits! Count how many tops and how many bottoms you have, then let something choose 2 numbers for you (Google has a random number generator when you search for "random number"). If you get, let's say, 8 and 3, take the 8th top and the 3rd bottom in you wardrobe, then try to make an outfit out of them by choosing a jacket, accessories, etc.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Let's talk the impact of fragrance on perception of style! How much does a person's fragrance affect your impression of them? Do you choose perfume with this in mind? What are some of your favourites?	labels:Almost all perfume and cologne will trigger migraines for me. Heavy floral scents are the worst, but very little of it won't affect me at least somewhat. So for me, when I smell perfume on someone, I make a mental note to keep my physical distance from them because I never know if they're going to be wearing something in the future that will give me a migraine that will take a couple of days to resolve.	episode_done:True
text:Have you ever participated in a clothing swap - in person or online?	labels:In the Before Times I would host one or two per year--I would make a facebook event and invite maybe 20 people (and just text friends who didn't have social media) and I'd usually get around 10 folks that showed up. I usually served mimosas and encouraged people to bring hors d'oeuvres so that it was also a little brunch gathering too. Some of the pieces I got from those have given me the most mileage over the years, and often they're items I never would have thought to look for!   I don't know if I'd do the digital ones, feels more like thrifting given the shipping cost and these days I prefer to buy secondhand via poshmark and whatnot since I am better able to find exactly what I'm looking for. Personally I'd be comfortable right now with an in person swap that takes place entirely outside (with mask required to use the bathroom) with a very small group of people I know, but I don't want to put pressure to do that on anyone else so I've just donated my clean-out clothes. Plus half the fun is trying something on and having your friends help you decide to keep it or leave it, and I don't know how I'd make that work outdoors. God I miss pre-2020...
text:You hit on the social aspect it can have too especially among friends.  You can get to know some of the stories behind stuff and why things do / don't work for folks. Ugh, I miss pre-2020 too - we'll get back to normal someday.	labels:	episode_done:True

I also bought a few clothing items that is taking forever to ship though. I might cancel some of them and wait out the rest. I mean, 30ish bucks for dresses/jumpsuits and 40s for cashmere is a pretty good deal, and it's not like Everlane's style is gonna change much. They sell the same shit year in and year out.

text:What are some habits that keep clothes/shoes new vs that habits that ruin them?	labels:First for cardigans and sweaters is I either go fully wool or fully cotton. Can‚Äôt be any sort of blend, and I avoid mohair. I have a cotton cardigan from urban outfitters that‚Äôs like 5-6 years old and looks brand new, so you don‚Äôt even need to go super pricey, just look at fabric content.  Second is I wash everything on cold, and hang dry as often as possible. Heat basically transforms fabric, so using it is unnecessary. I also find that it sets pit stains instead of removes them.  Shoes I have no idea. I walk a lot and constantly wear out shoes. I find leather with a sewn in sole lasts a lot longer, but flats and heels never last that long. I‚Äôve also had luck with shoes that have wooden soles which I‚Äôve added a sole with traction to.  For bags, I‚Äôve always heard it‚Äôs bad luck to keep them on the ground, but that‚Äôs more superstition than keeping it nice lol.
text:Yes! This! Also, washing them too often will destroy them quickly. I usually hang them and let them air for a day or two after wearing them, then re-wear them, and do so until they really need to be washed. Of course it only applies to outer layers, not underwear.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:FAQ: When shopping on a budget, what items have the highest point at which they reach diminishing returns?	labels:In my experience, lower quality at lower price points is most noticeable for outerwear, footwear, or knits (I guess because they all serve a functional purpose) and spending more tends to lead to a more noticeable improvement in quality up to a certain point. That's painting with a broad brush though... leather dress shoes and boots scale much better than sneakers or sandals, where mid-range options are going to be good enough for most people.  T-shirts, dress shirts, denim, and accessories in low-to-mid-range are generally good enough from a quality perspective IMO and I've only really paid more in those categories for a design I like rather than because I think I'm getting something higher quality. There's nothing wrong IMO with buying something because you like the way it looks even if a similar quality alternative exists at a lower price, but that's harder to do if you're shopping on a budget.  I'll also add that for all of the above, your dollar goes a lot farther if you're willing to shop used. Sites like Ebay, Grailed, reddit/styleforum B/S/T threads, etc. have made it a lot easier to buy preowned clothes without having to set foot into a thrift store.  TL;DR When shopping on a budget I'd focus first on having a high quality pair of shoes and jacket. Consider buying used clothes to stretch your budget further.
text:I'd say it goes Shoes > Coat/Jacket > Trousers/Jeans > Socks > Shirts > Underwear > Tshirts.  I'm not saying that you can get away with crappy tees but you can definitely find a tee for ¬£10 that's better quality than some of the ¬£80 ones. Favourite tees I've ever owned are Uniqlo U at around ¬£13 and a JCrew washed pocket tee they did maybe 10 years ago that I bought in the US for $20.  If your coat and your shoes are good, you can generally get away with budget on everything else provided it fits. I do think people underestimate how much of a difference a quality pair of denim and good socks make though.	labels:Seconding socks. Good socks are life changing. I read on reddit years ago not to skimp on anything that gets between me and gravity. Tires, boots, mattress, and socks. I rarely wear shoes (boots only) so my socks are purely for personal comfort, and nothing beats a good pair of wool socks. Go darn tough or rag wool knit socks from someone like LL Bean, and learn to darn them, and you'll never go back.	episode_done:True

text:What are some of your least favourite brands?	labels:I wouldn't say I inherently hate the brand but I think Champion is an example of a brand that exploded a few years back/to now basically all because some celebrities or whoever wore it- and everyone who wears it now is most likely a ding dong hypebeast type or the VSCO type girl or whatever. Like I'm old enough to remember it being bottom tier Wal Mart level shit you'd get borderline made fun of for wearing- but now all of the sudden it's enjoying this moment. So it's just that perceived inauthenticity and collective pivot in peoples' minds to a fashion name to people rather than just athletic apparel that irks me somehow.  However though, the Todd Snyder Champion stuff is PHENOMENAL- it's not the mainline stuff. You don't see any of those assholes rocking that.
text:A few years before you could get Champion at Walmart it was a higher end brand on the same tier as Adidas and Nike. So it went from hero to zero now back at hero.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Cotton Candy Femme Fatale: A Cassie (Promising Young Woman) inspo album	labels:Oh my god that straw hat/doily dress?? Perfection!!!   I love wearing a 'cute' look at the grand old age of 37, but I try and make sure all the cute bits are always neat, tidy and made of quality materials to avoid looking too 'kiddy'. Quality fabrics and well-made vintage always elevate a look, I think!	episode_done:True
text:Shitpost Saturday: Signature Scent	labels:Scent notes: Scotch, Wet Cardboard, Desperation  The fragrance opens with a waft of the burning tire and old bandaid scent of a mid-shelf scotch, which gives way to the aroma of old pizza boxes and a hint of compost, suggesting something might be rotting away inside one of them. The fragrance is unified with a current of dust and desperation, evoking memories best left repressed.	episode_done:True

text:Lugged boot trend	labels:I love this style of boot and I'll probably buy a pair, but definitely not the Prada ones, not only because das esspenssive, but because they're a very all-out version that I won't wear in 2 years, when it will have already gone out of style.   But the Docs, the Zara ones or another "inspired by", but toned down version is more likely to make it into the next years with me.

text:General Tips To Spice Up Wardrobe	labels:I agree with the commenter below to work what you already have in different ways. A lot of people think they need a new wardrobe or a lot of new items, but really it's often just wearing things they already have differently.

I know exactly what I want, but I've not yet managed to find one that's somewhat affordable, but not made from plastic.
text:Idk where you‚Äôre located but US department store Dillards has (at least had) great options for silk/ satin gowns for $120 and under.

I have a few thoughts on how to participate in the "spirit" of this theme:  ‚Ä¢ Fits that demonstrate a heavy amount of structure and "solidity," (i.e. a minimum of flow) while suggesting internal human movement (your fit is a building, with a person or people in it); an example of this a loose sweater or shirt layered under a heavy coat  ‚Ä¢ Fits that include details that suggest buildings and architecture: thick materials like leather and wool, metal jewelry (silver, stainless steel, etc) or wood jewelry  ‚Ä¢ Large caps, boots, tightly-tied scarves  ‚Ä¢ literally tie bricks to your shoes lol	episode_done:True

text:Fashion to help your changing body and lifestyle?	labels:Lifestyle and body changes will take place and impact your wardrobe and style needs a few times over the course of your life, and 20s is sort of when most navigate this for the first time. The most important thing to determine is what if anything in your current wardrobe can work for you now, including your work looks, and what look you want to have with your style for work. This should fit into your industry and be appropriate, but it can still be 'you' (your vibe, etc.), it just takes some thought and planning. Clothing is 100% the wrapper so to speak we all wrap around ourselves, and can reflect who we are, where we are at in our lives, how we feel about ourselves, and alot of other aspects about yourselves. Aim to tie it as closely to you, and what your life needs are. That is how it has been effective for me here.

text:PSA: Revive by Rent the Runway via Thredup	labels:I'm a frequent thredup buyer and seller but I do so with lots of caveats.   &#x200B;  1) I don't buy higher end goods from them because a) I don't trust the authenticity and b) they charge wayyyyyy more for more mid-level and up 'designer' or higher end brands. I'll just use Coach as an example. Vintage full leather Coach bags on thredup will sell for 50% or way way more than that same item on eBay from a random seller.   2) The level of use of their garments can really vary and the quality control is lacking. I've ordered items that were supposed to only be gently worn (they shouldn't really be selling anything that's more obviously worn), and gotten those items only to see that they are covered in animal hair and have obvious odors. But again, this isn't a constant issue and I don't buy final sale items from them so I can just return them.   &#x200B;  All of that having been said, I won't buy RTR items from thredup. I don't trust that their pricing will be reasonable secondhand market value nor do I trust the quality of the items.	episode_done:True
text:How do I feel more comfortable "dressing up"?	labels:1) Be early when you're dressed up. People will assume you're late because you were getting dressed even if that's not true.  2) It might actually help to wear the clothes around the house. Even just for an hour or two on your day off then hang them up again in the closet 3) Do you love to look at dresses or wear them? I really like to look at high heels, but I just don't buy them because they make me uncomfortable. If the dresses are making you uncomfortable, then maybe they're not really "you." Maybe you just enjoy collecting them?
text:This right here. Wearing it around the house until you forget you have it on is how I got over the fear of wearing dark lipsticks. Besides you get the feel of if you're actually comfortable or not.  Most importantly you understand if you're wearing it for yourself or others.	labels:	episode_done:True

While in highschool (I was even smaller back then) I wore a coat by London Fog and was able to make it work and probably could again but, it would be nice to be able to wear something a little less baggy as I won't *always* be layered up.

text:Engineered Garments.  I really like their stuff, but I'm just too deep in the rabbit hole of my own Ivy/basic bastard style amalgam to try to incorporate an EG vibe too.

text:Hats and how to wear them	labels:Honestly the biggest issue with hats for me is wind. Especially in England. I pretty much exclusively wear extremely wide brimmed hats because I'm still doing the  'wide brimmed hat for a witchy vibe' thing - especially on a bad hair day. I find that very feminine romantic looks really suit hats like this and I have similar large straw hats that kinda go with anything soft and flowy in warm weather. The appearance of cottagecore really helped bring back big beautiful straw hats, including ones with large ribbon ties for the neck/chin.	episode_done:True

text:As somebody who reverse engineers clothes all the time, if you can think of something you found appealing from a media wardrobe then you can probably find a reverse engineered example. If not exact copies then pretty close. Clothing is all basically built from the same blocks, and if there's a suitably dedicated fan base then somebody has likely made it.

text:Are Luxury Fashion Brands Becoming Like Fast Fashion?	labels:I'd say to some degree yes. Most fashion houses are rtw/couture first and accessories second. They dipped into the handbag and accessories market to make more money, but the real quality (and bread and butter) for most fashion houses is their rtw.   Chanel is in this weird spot where they're trying to outrun the secondhand market and regain the exclusivity they once had. They're trying to be Hermes but they could never be Hermes because Chanel is not known for their leather.   So yes, I think when it comes to handbags/SLGs/accessories most luxury houses are trying to put out the latest and greatest and kind of mimic fast fashion to some degree. They're appealing to a market that can't afford to become their regular clientele. The people whom they can't text when the latest $7000 tweed jacket is released each season and know that they can walk away with a $10,000+ sale. So brands are trying to push out the latest and greatest handbags, SLGs and shoes.   In terms of rtw, I do think the traditional fashion calendar is very fast paced, but several brands have said they will step away from the traditional calendar and cut it back down to 2-3 releases per year. It will be interesting to see what this means for S/S and F/W collections.   Commenting more on the handbag/accessories market:  I say this as someone is kind of handbag crazy, but I do wish people would do more research about the brands and bags they purchase. People assume that just because a bag is marked up it's handmade by an artisan who specializes in leather but that isn't the case for most brands.   If anyone is looking for Hermes alternatives I highly suggest Delvaux. Valextra and Moynat also have fantastic craftsmanship. But I bought my first box leather bag from Delvaux last year and it's on a completely different level from Chanel.
text:Great post! I'd never heard of Delvaux, just been looking at their bags - beautiful!! Just found a vintage Delvaux leather pouch that I've now bought for ¬£25! Thanks for the intro to the brand.	labels:You‚Äôre welcome! Delvaux is really underrated and more popular in Asia but the craftsmanship is on par with Herm√®s.	episode_done:True
text:When is a garment worth it to you?	labels:For most reasonably priced items, my rule is (unless there an urgent sale) to wait ~3-4 weeks. If I still want the item just as bad, I get it (or wait for a sale to get it). If I‚Äôm excited about something else, then so be lol  For expensive items, I do the same but also find an excuse (holiday, birthday, publish a paper, etc.)
text:This is good advice in general, the more expensive the item, the longer you should wait. I‚Äôve been contemplating a need Audi for about a year, might pull the trigger next winter!	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Tips for easily looking more modern/in style?	labels:I've heard the advice to buy 5 low-cost pieces of clothing that is in fashion per season to keep up with trends. Obviously if you see something more expensive that you love then feel free to go for it but my main point being that it doesn't have to be an entire new wardrobe of high priced clothing, it can literally be ¬£50-100 at H&M 4 times a year buying pieces that slot into your existing wardrobe (e.g. a top or a coat or a pair of shoes). If a certain style becomes precious to you then you can always upgrade that piece.  Like for example skinny jeans are not quite the fashion of the moment but you'd still look pretty current if you paired them with a puff sleeve top. Sleek white trainers are not as on trend as some of the chunkier clunky dad styles in white but they'd still look OK with your slightly frumpy prairie dress.	episode_done:True
text:How often do you wash your clothes?	labels:You all do a lot of laundry!  I only wash base layers (panties, socks, camis, undershirts, leggings, hosiery) regularly. Everything else I hang up on a garment rack to air out. I hit it with cheap vodka in a spray bottle to deodorize/sanitize. I learned that trick in costume class in college, much more skin safe than febreze. I use a steamer to get out the wrinkles and reshape. I recycle my old toothbrush brushes/cut up tshirt rags to spot clean with felsnaptha or oxi clean.  If you have good hygiene and aren‚Äôt sweating, there‚Äôs really no need to wash most things, especially with a washing machine. Clothing experiences a lot of friction while being agitated in the machine and that will wear your fibers out.

text:Ellen McArthur Circular Economy Report: by 2029 Resale is expected to be bigger than Fast Fashion	labels:Psyched to hear it. I'm a huge fan of physical and online consignment stores.   Thrift stores are great and I sometimes have the energy to dig through the esoteric offerings they have, but a well-curated consignment shop, especially an independent one is great for the community, great for sellers, great for the environment and great for me. So long as store owners are conscientious when examining the pieces they accept in-store, and are reasonable when they do the pricing, I think consignment shopping is the ideal shopping experience for me. I can find excellent condition, unique pieces from a variety of brands, at different price points - at price points far below what it would cost retail.	episode_done:True

text:How much was your most expensive fashion item and when or how often do you wear it?	labels:My most expensive items have all been high quality copies of items I have in low quality but wore out the wazoo.  For example, I knew I was ready to invest in some high end Chelsea boots when I found myself going through a cheap pair every year. Or to invest in a nice leather-looking jacket when I found myself grabbing mine 70% of the time I went out.  The expensive items were hard to wear at first, maybe on date nights or to a nicer event, but as I got more used to wearing them I wore them more often. I think it took me a hot year before I wore my Red Wings more than like once a month.   My recommendation is keep the items in your comfort zone (so no wild dresses or Colors at first) and to force yourself to wear it at a regular interval. These days, just wearing nice jeans while I go shopping seems to be my ‚Äúdate night‚Äù when I dress up!
text:This is absolutely how I do it too. It gives the security of knowing that you will wear and love that expensive piece and (depending on the item) it can save you in the long run. This is a wonderfully practical way to go!	labels:	episode_done:True

text:How many pairs of jeans and pairs of shoes should you own?	labels:Women can have things they enjoy having without being concern trolled about how much they really need it.   I don't see men getting hassled for the amount of electronic waste their hobbies produce.   I doubt every fifth post in the Funko Pop subreddit is about curbing consumption and how they should be rethinking their involvement in a plastics based interest.   Personally, I think they're wasteful as shit, but I'm not about to roll up into their space and shame them for it.  I'm so over the handwringing, guilt, and joylessness about fashion in this sub sometimes.

Like. How is that even happening?!
text:They're either incapable of understanding the basics of doing laundry that even a teenager can manage or they're lying, girl.   Any excuse to distance themselves from the poors and justify overpriced clothes because paying over $100 on a shirt means it's "better quality" than the $20 all the poors can afford. It's not.  They're just treating their cheap clothes like shit because they're cheap. The name brand stuff gets handwashed with angel tears by virgins with long hair in sundresses. Then they're surprised pikachu when the H&M sweater pills and the Sezane one does not.   Or even better, the h&m sweater is *obviously* shit because it pilled, but when your sweater is $300, pilling is suddenly "inevitable" and just use an electric shaver.	labels:Someone asked how to avoid sweaters disintegrating in the wash, so i asked what they meant, and they meant literally just pilling.  So I guess you're spitting truth lol

So, go in mind with what you like, and then Pinterest will start figuring you out.	episode_done:True
text:Dressing larger bodies - without looking sloppy	labels:This goes for any size, but I think the oversized/shapeless trend is done well with styling.  Perfectly tailored items, luxe fabrics, and generally styling yourself to look polished (hair, makeup, jewelry, whatever your thing is) really helps avoid looking or feeling sloppy.  I really enjoy loose tops, and find if they have a nice drape it helps. I'm short, so I try to offset the volume up top by wearing something slim on the bottom.	episode_done:True

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE!- October 24	labels:can someone elaborate on the difference between the following 5 types of coats?: peacoat, duffle coat, trench coat, top coat, and overcoat?
text:A peacoat is a specific type of wool coat. It is derived from the military pea coat and will be double-breasted, if navy or charcoal wool (usually thick wool-nylon or pure wool), be thigh length,  tonal buttons, slightly curved collar iirc.   A duffle cost I can‚Äôt remember the specifics but I think has a good and toggle buttons? Could be wrong.  A trench is a raincoat, generally cotton or at least not wool, usually tan, doubtle breasted, belted, mid thigh or knee length.  Top coat and overcoat are generally pretty interchangeable iirc longer wool coats , single breasted, wool. A lot of variety under those terms but usually a top coat is intended to be worn over a suit iirc.   Different manufacturers will use a lot of these terms interchangeably which can be confusing.	labels:The difference between a top coat and an overcoat is actually in the weight of the fabric; overcoats area heavier. Both are to be worn over tailoring.

I don't have zero synthetics but I do make a concerted effort to avoid them as much as possible	episode_done:True
text:What do you like, fashion-wise, about loose-fitting clothing?	labels:Took me a while to appreciate that loose != ill fitting and form fitting != well fitting. For example, that jacket accentuates the model's waist, is a good length in the arms, flatters their neck, and has a lot of interesting structural details and textures. The idea for me isn't baggy for bagginess sake, but usually some interesting structure or contrast in tandem with a more fitted piece or the natural outline of my body.	episode_done:True
text:London street style Inspo (circa 1985-1990s)	labels:Hi all! This album is just a collection of street styles taken from London circa 1985-1990s by Mr. Shoichi Aoki.      I was very much surprised when going through the photos today because of how good the fits are considering they're mostly from the mid 80s. These looked like styles from the streets of Tokyo & Seoul but they turned out to from the UK instead. I know in terms of fashion many countries draw inspiration from each other but I never expected the folks in London to be so in command and stylish from such an early period!      Another pleasant surprise was how similar these fits look to the current trend of streetwear, high fashion / avantgarde style in the recent 2-3 years. If I had no clue of the year these photos were taken from, I wouldn't have a problem believing that they were from recent years.

text:What does business casual mean to you?	labels:I think it's basically woven or high end knit items that are tailored and polished. So chinos, a button down, a merino sweater, skirts, dresses, etc.   I think jersey knits, tees, jeans, sneakers---those can squeak in on a casual day and if styled impeccably, but I lean towards woven in general.   Coverage wise, it's usually from the neck to the knees continuously or more (meaning no belly shirts, no cut outs, and if it's sleeveless, it's not a tank top or camisole alone).   Tightness wise I think it's "skimming" the body. It's not tight, snug, or showing off curves, but it's not baggy in a casual way. I do think biz caz can be oversized, but that's like...advanced biz caz, like a loose linen dress with a loose linen blazer and simple flats on a hot day type deal.   Generally patterns and prints are small and discreet, no slogans, and no "novelty" items or promotional wear.   No workout items, no sleepwear or lingerie.   In your case, I think the events are indicating "smart casual" meaning no open toes/flip flops, no jeans, shorts, tees, or other overly-casual items.	episode_done:True

Grab an assortment of camel/chestnut browns too. & then find some mute shades of Green (not emerald or teal), but more like green shade that are within range of a Matcha green color....and voila!

text:DAE feel a disconnect between fashion you see in movies or TV and fashion you see in real life?	labels:Don't forget that the clothes you see on TV or in films are costumes, even if it's not a "costume drama". They fit well on screen because the whole look has been designed - everyone's outfits, the setting and so on. So unless it's a deliberate choice everything is going to look cohesive. By deliberate choice I mean things like a character wearing obviously different clothes to most of the rest of the cast to show they're old fashioned, or quirky and so on.  I'm certainly not saying don't look to film and TV for inspo, but either try to modify what you see to more match where you are, or accept the fact you might look more dressed up than the majority and go with it anyway.	episode_done:True

text:How many clothes do you have? (Really?)	labels:I think the size of your wardrobe is going to depend on your climate, job, hobbies, and general lifestyle. I have a lot more clothing than that. I also live in a place with four seasons. I have outdoorsy hobbies that require some tougher clothes. I can‚Äòt wear my casual clothing to work (and I‚Äôm also holding onto some more professional clothing from a past job in case I return to that field). I don‚Äôt have a lot of disposable income either, so I always keep things like dress pants even though I never wear them in my everyday, because I can‚Äôt afford to go shopping when interviews and funerals come up.  For instance, I probably have at least 15 dresses alone, once you count all the strappy sundresses, nice work dresses, wool sweater dresses, the cocktail dresses, and the evening gown that‚Äôs in the back of my closet - and everything in between.  I swap out my clothing with the seasons and have one closet that I share with my husband, so I try to be judicious about what I keep, while giving myself grace that I don‚Äôt need to get rid of something just because I don‚Äôt wear it regularly.

text:Is Y2K fashion coming back organically or is it a result of progressing the 90's comeback to the next decade since that trend seemed to work out?	labels:Everything eventually comes back in fashion.  Personally I would love for 2000s jeans to come back - not super low rise or the ones that were bedazzled or laced up but just normal rise bootcut and flare jeans. I have a few from that era that I still wear all the time and a couple more that I had to replace with similar ones from poshmark because I couldn't find them in shops.  I also miss 2000s makeup. Sure, there was too much body glitter and candy colors but there was also the fresh dewy look of blush and a light lip gloss - think Britney Spears in her Oops I Did It Again video, or Mandy Moore's makeup in her video for Candy. Not everything in the 2000s was horrible lol.

I still think the best makeup I've ever seen was in Mean Girls. Everything from the color choices to the application. Everyone just looked more alive lol. The baked face/matte colors/highlight and contouring that eventually became popular was pretty in it's own way but I felt like it made everyone look like plastic barbie dolls. I'm glad that trend is slowly dying out and I'm finally seeing more lipglosses and rosy shades being sold again.	episode_done:True

I just bought one a couple weeks ago because, like you, I‚Äôm a fan of clean lines and I want to wear certain things that tend to be most flattering on people with smaller chests. Shift dresses always make me look super overweight/shapeless because they don‚Äôt fall right on me, but a minimizer bra can help the dress lay a little flatter. They also reduce/eliminate that dreaded gap when wearing a button-up shirt, and I find that they help me to look less....Pamela Anderson-y when wearing tight fitting tops.	episode_done:True

Eventually I got sick of them gathering dust so I'd wear them to class with thick long cardigans, and bright coloured tights or slouchy socks/boots. I also sometimes wear dresses as "skirts" by pulling a hoodie or crewneck over it.  I love blazers but like to wear them casually too. So I sometimes wear my fav blazer with jeans/leggings and a concert T to go run errands. Sometimes I top it with a wide-brimmed felt hat.	episode_done:True

text:How has your style and shopping habits changed with age and financial standing?	labels:I'm in my early thirties and live a comfortable life. In my early twenties I loved shopping for secondhand clothing and had a regular loop of my local thrift stores, Clothes Mentors, and consignment shops. I was always on the hunt for a good deal and was really developing my personal style (with a lot of experimentation and questionable choices.)  A few things that I've been reflecting on recently:  1. I no longer find shopping (specifically browsing) fun. Now I would much rather seek out a specific item on Poshmark and only shop to replace needed items or fill legitimate gaps.  2. Related to the above, I have a short list of brands that I buy and it's based on quality, warranty (I have a lot of outdoor/athletic gear), and environmental impact. Right now, I'm looking for a Patagonia Houdini for at least 50% off retail. I'm not in a rush to buy it but I'm also not aimlessly shopping for "a windbreaker" and then come home with three t-shirts. 3. Fabric/fit snobbery. I don't care if the cutest top I've ever seen is on clearance for $3... if it's 100% polyester it's just not coming home with me. Same with "I really like it, but if only it..." I have far more clothing than I need so there's never a moment where buying a pair of leggings is the difference between owning pants and going to work naked. I can wait till I find the perfect item.  4. Lifestyle creep is real! Across all my spending (groceries, clothing, hobbies) I just don't pay attention to the cost as much. I still have an upper threshold that gives me pause, but I don't have any month-to-month "oh, I can't afford that right now." Which, I really should be saying far more often!   All together, it takes most of the fun out of shopping because I am so picky and can usually say, "okay, I really don't need/want this."
text:Mid 30s, and this all rang so true for me. It was a sad day when I was finally honest with myself and realized I just don‚Äôt like ‚Äúgoing shopping‚Äù anymore.  I used to be able to spend hours combing through the racks at Last Call or Off 5th looking for an amazing deal or whatever struck my fancy.   Now I know what I want, I want to price check a few other sites to make sure I‚Äôm getting a decent price, and I want to be done with it.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:How many clothes do you have? (Really?)	labels:I think the size of your wardrobe is going to depend on your climate, job, hobbies, and general lifestyle. I have a lot more clothing than that. I also live in a place with four seasons. I have outdoorsy hobbies that require some tougher clothes. I can‚Äòt wear my casual clothing to work (and I‚Äôm also holding onto some more professional clothing from a past job in case I return to that field). I don‚Äôt have a lot of disposable income either, so I always keep things like dress pants even though I never wear them in my everyday, because I can‚Äôt afford to go shopping when interviews and funerals come up.  For instance, I probably have at least 15 dresses alone, once you count all the strappy sundresses, nice work dresses, wool sweater dresses, the cocktail dresses, and the evening gown that‚Äôs in the back of my closet - and everything in between.  I swap out my clothing with the seasons and have one closet that I share with my husband, so I try to be judicious about what I keep, while giving myself grace that I don‚Äôt need to get rid of something just because I don‚Äôt wear it regularly.
text:Hobbies are a big one. I ride horses, work out, sometimes hike, and have a professional job.

text:Unique brands/boutiques in your city?	labels:Some nice places around Europe:  * Switzerland:    * Geneva: on weekends, there's a flea market around the park near Patek Philippe Museum. I loved it especially for vintage fashion magazines and books but also clothes and jewelries.    * Lausanne, Boutique Etat d‚ÄôAme: kind of elegant garments with a twist. I love especially their shoes, they have elevated designs of classic types of shoes.    * Lausanne, MANIAK Boutique: this is a really fun and weird boutique where you'll find: some second-hand items, leather jackets and corsets, costume stuff, urban brands like Dickies and Carhartt, vintage dresses, etc. It's a really fun, quirky mess of everything. Every time I went there I bought something, it's one of my favorite shops ever.    *  Z√ºrich: There's a nice flea market in Stadthausanlage on weekends.    *  Z√ºrich, Fizzen: part second-hand, part regular shop, it has some nice designs similar to MANIAK in Lausanne. Also in Z√ºrich, Barbar Vintage usually has a large selection of SH jeans and on Bleicherweg there are some more high-end vintage stores near the offices of consulting companies (what a coincidence). * France, Annecy: there is (was? maybe temporarily cancelled because of Covid-19) a quite large monthly flea market on the last Saturday of every month. I went there once especially for this and it was amazing. * Romania, Bucharest: some local boutiques are Ioana Ciolacu (designer items), Ana Urbana (shoes), Gazzelle (shoes and bags), Diana Cojocaru (unique porcelain jewelry, doesn't have a regular store but regularly hosts exhibitions around Bucharest, worth checking her Instagram account), IONA (lovely gold jewelry), Malvensky (also nice gold jewelry), Iutta (handbags and shoes with traditional motives).

Sometimes I‚Äôd add a long necklace, sometimes just super simple earrings. It worked every time, my magic dress.

text:Sustainability and "Indulgence" in Era of the Rona	labels:I've been on a fashion sustainability journey for a while now - in 2019 I vowed to only buy recycled fibers - and did so until early 2020. Somewhere along the line, I realized that's really not the best thing, and went on a no-buy.  Then I discovered depop.   I was pretty restrained to begin with, then, driven by my love for variety that is quite similar to yours, went on a bit of a spree of buying all the things I've been holding back from for a few years. That said, I probably only purchased 10-15 items in total, and out of those, only one has turned out to be a dud (slightly too small, will sell on), so I'm pretty pleased.  I also naturally tend to buy things that will fit with the rest of my closet, so I never had much of an issue there. It was a little difficult when I decided to transition from a very professional to a more "me" wardrobe, but I did it over time, and now I'm quite happy with how it's gone.   The thing I did recently is branch out into accessories - and I've been getting either second-hand/vintage, or unique handmade items from artisans. That's been a whole lot of fun, and I feel like I'm supporting the right people.  I don't have that many restoration tips, but I've learned some decent care tips over time. My favourite one at the moment concerns white shoes (sue me, I'm a sucker for them) - wipe them down every time you wear them and they likely won't require a huge clean at any point! Depending on where you go, of course. I also like to air out my clothing before I decide they absolutely need a wash, especially blazers. If you're persistent enough, most smells will dissipate over time. Just don't put anything in direct sunlight, colours might get washed out!	episode_done:True

So far, I've identified the following brands:   Billy Reid   Todd Snyder   Buck Mason   Alex Mill  Sweaters should be in the $100 to $400 range.  Thank you.

text:Excercises for personal style	labels:I recently watched a tedx "Dressing for Confidence and Joy", where the presenter Stasia Savasuk asked people to think about how they wanted to be perceived in the world by thinking about key words, and then to think about articles of clothing or accessories that fit in that keyword category. For example, if  Person A wanted to be perceived as confident, they would ask themselves if the article of clothing or whatever fit inside the "confident" bubble.  I found that idea to be useful. So the first step is choosing your keywords, and then considering them when you shop or dress yourself.

text:Capsule wardrobes?	labels:I just did the same thing! I created a test capsule and put it in a specific section of my closet. I dressed exclusively from it for 2-3 weeks, and still mostly am (I ordered a couple of wish list items so I added those when they arrived).  I also felt like it was easier to get dressed (fewer choices) and my outfits were more in line with my desired style. That‚Äôs actually why I did my capsule ‚Äî I came to the end of about two years of style exploration and wanted to test whether the conclusions I came to were right for me. They are!   Here‚Äôs the list of what I put in my warm weather capsule. I have another list ready for when the weather gets consistently cooler:  [x]2 sundresses  [x]Navy midi skirt  [x]Navy-based floral midi skirt  [x]Pink-based floral midi skirt  [x]2 pairs athletic / long shorts suitable for hiking/adventures ‚Äì tan long & navy athletic  [x]Floral-print jersey-knit top  [x]Floral-print blouse  [x]Coral top (I think I ended up adding a second one of these so I wouldn‚Äôt have to do laundry)  [x]Navy top  [x]Chambray button-down shirt  [x]2 athletic tops for hiking/adventures  [x]1 pair dark green joggers  [x]Brown leather sandals  [x]Gray casual sneakers  [x]Adventure shoes  [x]Gold & rhinestone necklace  My colors are navy, coral/pink, dark green, and a little yellow.   I‚Äôve been outfit repeating a ton for the last several months (wearing the same outfit for 3-5 days in a row), so that made doing a capsule easier as well.	episode_done:True

text:What are some habits that keep clothes/shoes new vs that habits that ruin them?	labels:Give shoes a day break between wearings.  A shoe repair guy said that even with socks, shoes absorb a lot of moisture from our feet. He suggested going  at least day on day off with shoes to give them time to dry and regain their shape. Otherwise he said they stay in that moist, malleable state and get out of shape more quickly.  Anecdotally I‚Äôve seen a major difference in the lifespan of my shoes.

text:Distinct Fashion Phases	labels:I‚Äôm also a teen and I‚Äôm new to styling and clothes and fashion and all.  When I was little (basically from when I was 5 to like around 9) I was what some people called a stereotypical girly girl. I only wanted to wear skirts. Hated pants. I *loved* pink. I loved to wear cool and frilly skirts and also skirts with graphic prints (and by that I mean Hello Kitty I was obsessed lmao) and also I loved dresses.   Then when I was around 10/11 I started straying away from dresses and more towards jeans and sweatshirts and graphic tees and Hot Topic t-shirts. And basically just continued just that casual style with jeans and a t-shirt lol.   Now I‚Äôm starting to get into fashion and finding out what I like. I‚Äôm also getting into more vintage looking things thanks to vintage and sewing youtubers such as Karolina Zebrowska, Bernadette Banner, Rachel Maksy, and etc. Now I still have a lot of the Hot Topic shirts and jeans and all but I‚Äôm getting into styling them. And also I‚Äôve gotten rid of a lot of my wardrobe that I just didn‚Äôt want/like/fit me anymore.  I have/had a lot of clothes that I like but I don‚Äôt feel especially passionate about. Very few pieces make me feel especially passionate or I love thoroughly. But  now I‚Äôm getting a few pieces that I know I‚Äôm going to *love* and are going to develop the style I want (which is probably a casually edgy victorian 50s Newsie with a modern twist lmao. Idk lol) And I‚Äôm also starting to get into sewing some clothes I like (haven‚Äôt started but I bought the supplies for sewing two skirts. ).   Also now I have a badass jean jackets and more beanies. I love beanies. Lol      Don‚Äôt really have much to say about my makeup journey because I don‚Äôt wear any. Other than when I was little I use to wear it for dance recitals and was into makeup. Then I just wasn‚Äôt anymore. Now I‚Äôm getting into skincare (because of my mom) and I‚Äôm considering getting some makeup and starting off with it. But I‚Äôm kinda clueless lmao.

And for the top maybe "bib front blouse", "peter pan collar blouse", "tuxedo blouse" depending on which of those elements appeals to you (I'm not 100% sure what the blouse is though).	episode_done:True

text:General Discussion - February 15, 2021	labels:Covid has been super rough for me cause I‚Äôm a Pretty extroverted dude. This place has been great for allowing me to interact with people.

text:What's your fashion tragedy?	labels:I spent like two months investing in a bunch of nice wool sweaters that I could wear through the winter, put them in a separate laundry bin after wearing so I could launder them myself, but my ex washed and dried them on high heat and they all shrunk so badly that I couldn't even fit them on my dog. About $1500 gone.
text:I bought a gorgeous teal wedding kaftan with matching floor length vest and beaded waist belt in Morocco. It was really unique from all the others as it was much more understated and all the beadwork was also done with teal beads (different from most which have a lot of gold accents). I was particularly proud because I bargained down to 450 dirhams or around $45 for it.   Wore it once in Jardin Majorelle but without the floor length waist coat but was so excited to wear that piece with western clothes. Was even considering wearing it at my wedding.  Well, we make it back to a hostel in Madrid and since I can‚Äôt sleep, I take a little thc tincture to help put me to sleep. Well, I wake up high, 5 min before checkout and obviously, since my bag is quite full with gifts and Moroccan goodies now, my clothes are having a hard time fitting, so naturally, I put MY FAVORITE REFORMATION OUTFIT AND NEW MOROCCAN GOWN IN A PLASTIC BAG AND TIE IT TO THE OUTSIDE OF MY BACKPACK.   As we‚Äôre walking through the train to go to Seville, I realize that, SURPRISE!, bag is no longer attached and I lost it somewhere on the walk.   Obviously we called the hostel but it wasn‚Äôt there...3 hour train ride with my fianc√© was SILENT. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever been more angry and everytime I looked at that backpack for days it would make so angry.   Teal Kaftan, please know how sorry I am and how much I miss you.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Handbag conundrum: lesser know (and lesser seen all over the place) or standard luxury designer bags (think the usual Gucci, YSL, LV, etc.)	labels:Definitely buy what makes you happy. The fact that you have looked at the high end, well known brands and came away disappointed indicates that (this season at least), they aren't for you.   To answer your question directly: for me, personally, showing my own style is 1000% more important than showing the status of a luxury brand. Do the two sometimes overlap? Yes, and that's fine. But I don't personally get buying something *just* because it is a certain brand. Who are you trying to impress? What are you conveying with that logo (wow, you're well off? What kind of message is that, on its own?) I just feel like people who are super into labels, not the design or the style or anything else, just come across as kind of immature? The truth is, anyone worth spending much time with isn't overly concerned with what logo your bag has. (Now! I will concede there is a difference between showing off luxury brands and having higher end items, in some circles. Like, there could be some tension if you're hanging out with super millionaire socialites and everything you wear is from TJ Maxx...but in that case, I'd still say its important to focus on personal style first. And knowing about smaller higher end designers, rather than designers you can buy at a mall, is a whole different thing too...)
text:I feel like showing off the logo is more of a poor person trying to look rich thing. Truly wealthy people don't try to show off like that. Also, a lot of the purses with very prominent logos are fugly.	labels:> I feel like showing off the logo is more of a poor person trying to look rich thing.

text:Is Y2K fashion coming back organically or is it a result of progressing the 90's comeback to the next decade since that trend seemed to work out?	labels:Everything eventually comes back in fashion.  Personally I would love for 2000s jeans to come back - not super low rise or the ones that were bedazzled or laced up but just normal rise bootcut and flare jeans. I have a few from that era that I still wear all the time and a couple more that I had to replace with similar ones from poshmark because I couldn't find them in shops.  I also miss 2000s makeup. Sure, there was too much body glitter and candy colors but there was also the fresh dewy look of blush and a light lip gloss - think Britney Spears in her Oops I Did It Again video, or Mandy Moore's makeup in her video for Candy. Not everything in the 2000s was horrible lol.
text:It‚Äôs also worth discussing that a lot of the popular elements of the Y2K era have elements of 1960s and 1980s style as well, so Y2K style 20 years later includes those echoes as well.	labels:Yep, I remember when feathered hair made a comeback in the 2000s because of the 70s. Same with bootcut jeans, peasant blouses, and fringed accessories.	episode_done:True
text:General Discussion - December 20, 2020	labels:what's on ya'll's mind
text:I'm so young compared to the average MFA poster. Like we got people with careers and families on here and an awful amount of you are older than my dad while I'm on Christmas break from what would be high school in the US just fucking around with my unlimited free time.      Also it's crazy that there's people desperately trying to keep in touch with the youth (e.g. marketing departments) while I'm part of what LITERALLY defines what it means to be in touch with the youth. In 40 years they'll be looking back on today and I define what it is they look back on. It'll be really weird to have people my age in positions of power and I'll probably be constantly jealous of everyone cause they'll have done more with their time.      Also also I wonder if designers are gonna reference the youth culture of now in the future. Like Raf and Undercover have made punk and rave influenced clothes recently, will some future designer make DIY thrift-flip skater and e-boy/alt girl influenced clothes 30 years from now? Will that Celine E-boy collection be an important relic of this era? Are those IG brand album artwork 1 of 1 tapestry shirts gonna be in a museum some day? Is some designer gonna bring back the skinny jeans longline tee 2015 Kanye aesthetic as a deliberate callback?	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - December 04, 2020	labels: **Fjallraven Yupik Parka** vs. **Arctic Bay Nunavut Parka**   Fjallraven costs $660 and Arctic Bay costs $990 with 25% sale.  I know Arctic Bay outruns Fjallraven with insulation level and quality, but I liked the brand value of Fjallraven, and since it's almost $400 cheaper, I am still considering.  Plus I live in Vancouver, Canada where the coldest temperature is around -15 Celsius degree, so I do not need a Himalayan alpinist level insulation.

text:Decolonize Sustainable and Ethical Fashion	labels:>Understand that, in this day and age, words like ‚Äúsustainability‚Äù and ‚Äúeco-friendly‚Äù are just marketing buzzwords that often leave worker‚Äôs rights (mostly equal pay) out of the equation.   I can't explain how much it bothers me when a company mentions sustainability but acts like it doesn't understand that it's all encompassing. It includes not only environmental issues but community (people) as well.

text:How to find the confidence to wear clothes you like?	labels:Maybe for starters not listen to what your mom has to say. I was a tomboy and got girlie in a second when my first skirt turned out pretty. Mom told me I had scrawny legs which was exactly not a nice thing to say at the time. She also made me wear pantyhose with my skirts AND made me pay for them out of my allowance which was a huge bummer because I loved music and had a hard time buying albums as it was.

text:Quick tips to look UN-polished?	labels:My boyfriend tells me not to do this, his words are "fuck them. They don't matter. Dress how you want to" The one thing I'm massively insecure about is over dressing. I've been singled out for this a lot and it's frusting. I just want to look good. I'm not wearing inappropriate for the situation clothes either. It's more like I'm the only one in heels to dinner because I like them. And dinner like a nice place with drinks after not an ihop to a pool hall. The most picked at are a couple form fitting casual tshirt dresses I have. I love them them with some boots in the fall. But my casual clothes are not casual enough for everyone else? and they have to make comments about it. I get so anxious about it now I just sit naked on the floor for like 30 minutes staring at the few clothes I have left while my boyfriend checks in on me to see how my progress is going so we can leave finally.   But when it's just me and him going somewhere there's no problem at all. I'll wear anything confidently and feel great about it. But make me go to some kind of party or events where I know people and I just freak out and cry.   I want to look awesome. My boyfriend wants me to look awesome. Why are we trying to tone down our awesome because of how people want to be buttholes and judge us? For looking good. How are you going to let someone shame you for something you aren't ashamed of? Doesn't mean much comming from a girl who panics about going to dinner with friends but I try to remind myself of this all the time. I shouldn't have to dress down because it makes other people feel uncomfortable.
text:This sounds crazyyyy! Not you, but people who comment negatively on you looking nice!? Now that you mentioned it, I remember that someone in my social circle does this. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a really fancy dress. Are you going anywhere else after here?‚Äù Or ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs awfully nice looking for just a game night‚Äù. I usually respond to her with ‚ÄúYeah, I like dressing up‚Äù. Having a thick skin helps.	labels:It's wild because I have a pretty thick skin, like I've tackled felons and taken them to jail all while they trash talk me trying to get me riled up. But something about being criticized for looking good really messes me up.   I've had a lot of really negative experiences with it. I don't see any of those people anymore but I've heard women talk about other women so much I know I'm being talked about too. And I'm basically friendless now so I've been actively trying to get new friends. I feel like I can't look too good or I'll just be judged as a snobby attention seeking homewrecker and no one will want to be friends with me. And I body build so I've got a less common shape that gets talked about too. I love my body and I'm so proud of it but I don't feel comfortable around people. Everyone just looks at me. I've had people move tables entirely when I've sat down. I end up going alone to a lot of conferences and events and that's a hard blow when I'm just trying to be friendly and I can't fit in.	episode_done:True

Now, two decades later I dress a bit more conservatively around my family. Just jeans, a nice top or light sweater and makeup in colors found in the natural world. They think I‚Äôve lost my edge and became a little basic. Oh well.	episode_done:True

The Luxe Strategist: Very thoughtful posts on finances, shopping and general lie stuff.  I‚Äôll also add ExtraPetite / Jean Wang, though ever since she started blogging full time, her outfits aren‚Äôt nearly as consistently relevant for workplaces.  Also, pantsfessional is great - her posts got me interested in learning sewing, which has been a saving grace these past 8 months.  I‚Äôve noticed with some of these, it‚Äôs less so ‚Äòdaily OOTD‚Äô content and more often than not, a weekly/monthly cadence of varied content.

text:Yearly Aesthetic Goal Setting	labels:Great goals!  My goal for last year was to experiment with makeup, far outside my comfort zone. I normally cheat and just do "Floki eyes" when i go out dancing, but last year i did some lightning inspired crackles, a tree-like crackle (similar to the lightning so that was also kind of cheating), a circuit board motif across half my face, and a couple of different heavily Viking looks with bindrunes.  I will continue to try new things (i have one based on the lead dancer in the Suspiria remake on deck) as soon as we're allowed to go out dancing again.  Until then, my low key goal is to continue working my way through my mending box, and to take the logos off my favorite tshirts that are falling apart, and transfer them to either new tshirts or tanks, or if they are small enough to bowling style collared shirts/guyaberas.  Most of my tshirts are from charity or small business fundraisers, such as Pride or a local band, so i want to keep the memories alive even after the fabric decides to give up the ghost.	episode_done:True

text:clothes that you've made or altered significantly by hand that you're particularly proud of?	labels:I don't really sew but I lost a fair bit of weight last year and bought a nice dress for a wedding in February that was too big. I got quoted something ridiculous like ¬•30000 (about $300 I think) and the dress was only ¬£30!! I did it myself and it spurred me to take in loads of my clothes over lockdown, now most of my clothes fit me perfectly and it's amazing! I don't know why I didn't do it sooner.	episode_done:True
text:Difficulty distinguishing between so 'idealized' style and personal style?	labels:Right now, a lot of people's best intentions are devolving into "old lounge wear" because we haven't anywhere to go. Or when we have, it's running errands. Australia just got out of lockdown, I know Germany is going back in partially, the UK's going back in... and America is still a chaotic mess, but a lot of people are still working from home. So part of the answer may be "wait unti the world is different for you".
text:Yeah, if we don‚Äôt go out we slump and slouch watching tv eating food. That‚Äôs a great way to ruin some special pieces. If i‚Äôm out then i‚Äôm fine with standing straight and not being reclined. I need to plan some events so I can wear those pieces.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Do you: 1) keep all of your wardrobe equally diverse, or 2) keep all of your wardrobe minimal, or 3) keep some pieces relatively similar while diversifying others?	labels:In the old days where one got dressed I had somewhat of a personal uniform:   The perfect black pant (own four of them, cheap from h&m but perfect for me) plus the same blousish top in all nice colors they sell it in (short and long sleeve) plus cardigans in all nice colors they sell it in, though mostly black ones. Some neutral blazers. Some dresses.  For fancy appointments I own the same etui dress and blazer combination in black, navy and grey.   Shoes black leather (ballerina, winter, closed shoe, pumps).   My whole wardrobe fits in one ikea pax (1 meter/3 ft). Generally it is boring bottoms and some more color for the tops. I always feel huge in colored pants.

text:Bruce Boyer on Finding Your Wardrobe and Sustainability in Fashion ‚Äì Put This On (Derek Guy )	labels:i wish articles like this avoided the "expensive clothes sustainability" trope. the systems that lead to people being able to drop several thousand on a suit are inherently not sustainable, and i would love to see more discussion like that in the last question where consumption itself is addressed. imo the answer will involve more people taking responsibility for the origin of their own clothing with a focus on local labor and materials
text:Maybe this theme isn't foregrounded as much as you or I might like, but Boyer is clearly aware of it; he knows he was lucky enough to buy many of his clothes when they were modestly priced and that "decent ready-to-wear clothes are now available in  such a profusion of styles, quality, and the price I can‚Äôt imagine it  necessary to spend one‚Äôs whole salary on outfits. ... \[Besides,\] it‚Äôs just been in the modern age, an age of corporate commercial  consumerism, in which we‚Äôve turned our backs on the idea that the world  is finite. ... we must examine and re-think the relationship between democracy and capitalism to encourage more sustainable lifestyles."	labels:	episode_done:True

text:What are you hoping to buy on Black Friday?	labels:I haven‚Äôt planned yet but I‚Äôm glad of a few weeks to prep.  Most importantly, I need new running and hiking shoes (different ones) and would love to nab them on sale.  I‚Äôd also love to grab new socks and tights and replace some worn out pairs in my drawer, and maybe score one great underwire bra to complement my bralettes. Optionally, id also love a new swimsuit, but it‚Äôs very easy to pick the wrong size online.   In sartorial matters, I have been doing luxury minimalism for a long time and would love to score some loud accessories - a new everyday handbag in warm brown/ taupe tones (I have several in black but none in brown), some statement jewelry or scarves. I am also in the market for really adventurous, ethereal pieces, like big dresses, loud coats, colorful blouses, and structured pants.	episode_done:True
text:Do you follow the conventional rules around "flattering your figure?"	labels:I guess I don't really follow them because as a pear shape the advice is usually to emphasize the other body parts to draw attention away from the hips. But I like my butt, so I don't feel like I need to specifically hide it.  Also I think bootcut or flare jeans that are usually recommended just make my legs look like columns, and slimmer pants actually show that  I have slim legs and ankles (which to me looks nicer). I think a lot of this advice was based on the idea that the goal is to look as skinny as possible, so if anything is sticking out it needs to be obscured. My mom said she never wore jeans in the 80s/90s because she thought her butt was too big for them, and it's not even a particularly huge butt. So at the time the hourglass ideal was just overshadowed by the need to not look "fat" it any way (especially in the 90s).
text:The 'make your legs look wider to counteract your hips' is indeed bullshit. All it accomplishes is....making my legs look wider. And yet it's parroted in every single advice for pears I've seen. If it is a holdover from the 90s like you said, that would make a lot more sense to me, as I'm always a little salty about the terminology that's involved that implies wide hips need to be hidden away and de-emphasized and are therefore ugly. When in reality, they're sexy and great.	labels:I have wide hips and if I do it right, emphasizing them makes my waist look smaller by comparison and I'm super into that lol.	episode_done:True
text:How to Put Together a Successful Outfit ‚Äì Put This On	labels:I have a question that‚Äôs been nagging me as I‚Äôm still pretty new to this.  The section... ‚Äúpick an asthetic‚Äù... are you guys keeping a consistent asthetic from day to day or within a single outfit?  I feel strange sometimes wearing sleek monochrome top, black jeans and black chelsea boots one day and then a more workwear look the next.
text:For me it's day to day. My outfits definitely have some "shared DNA" between them, but I would say that each day I try for a different aesthetic to an extent	labels:I hate using the word "optimal" because constantly trying to min/max your wardrobe is a silly thing, but I think this is the optimal way of doing things. Day to day the aesthetic changes but the shared DNA of the entire wardrobe is a cross-section of a small handful of general aesthetic ideas that work well with one another.

text:General Discussion - January 03, 2021	labels:This year is getting worse and worse, my dad's just had to go hospital
text:Let me know if you need to talk. I lost my dad in 2019 -- we spent a month by his side in the hospital... So yeah, I've got an idea what you're going through, it can be a lot.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What is your one clothing item that makes your life better that everyone should have?	labels:A well fitted black wool coat in a cut that flatters you. It goes with any outfit. You can dress it up or down, and on early mornings taking the kids to school or late night runs to the store you look like you have your shit together even if your sans bra and wearing 3 day old leggings.
text:Any suggestions on where to find one? J crew and other sites have failed me this year	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What style rules or clothing attributes are you ruthless about?	labels:Nothing that needs to be dry cleaned except winter coats. Hate the smell, hate the bother, hate the expense.  No glitter, no metallic thread. I like it on other people, but on me it makes me feel like I‚Äôm wearing a costume. Sequins and paillettes only on formal evening wear (for me).  No dolman sleeves (for me). I don‚Äôt like how they look on my busty inverted triangle shape.
text:Dolman sleeves make me feel like a bat, and not in a good way.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:AE Elgin - Before & After recraft pics	labels:Oof, hell no	episode_done:True
text:Dream Unconventional/ Unrealistic Fashion Accessories- Discussion	labels:Cape. Cloak. However you say it, it‚Äôs me. Would I be more batman-esque, little red riding hood-esque or Daphne in Bridgerton traveling after her honeymoon-esque? Ideally, I would be all three. A woman has to have variety after all.	episode_done:True
text:What are some brands and designers inspired by traditional/folk/ethno clothing?	labels:Thank you for mentioning the Dior/ Bihor campaign. People rip off Romanian designs shamelessly, C√©line did it again a few days ago. I know it's off topic but it means a lot that you're speaking about it	episode_done:True
text:Shitpost Saturday: Thoughts and Prayers	labels:I'll be offering services at the Church of the Impulse Purchase. We'll all take communion of One Alcoholic Beverage Too Many, then kneel before the altar of Your Online Shopping Cart, and pray to our God, PayPal Express Checkout.   All to fight off the One True Demon, Feeling Your Feelings through the pious act of Waiting for Your Package to Arrive in the holy hands of the UPS Man, who will be carrying your salvation, the Pretty Thing You Bought That Is Sure to Fix Your Brain and Life.   The uniform is something new every week.

text:Brooks Brothers's Future Looks a Lot Like Menswear‚Äôs Past	labels:* Less SKUs. The amount of stuff BB sells is overwhelming.  * Do away with there weirdly named fit system. Change it to Extra Slim, Slim, Regular, Thicc Daddies * Revamp the BB website. It's been terrible for a long time. * Have the athleisure stuff, but also focus on high quality basics, again with less SKUs. Have something like an "essentials" line. The Navy Suit. The Charcoal Suit. The OCDB. The Chino. The Wool Trouser. Without fifty million variations thereof. You go now and it's like here are three navy suits with different kinds of stretch, here are four more with some kind of temperature controlling fabric. Just give me a half to full canvas lined 100% wool navy suit in various fits and sizes. In other words, simplify your menswear line to cut down on SKUs, and that will give you more room to play with sheep on skis and stuff (i think that does sound kind of cute, very Ralph Lauren). * Do away with Golden Fleece, Red Fleece. Mainline only. Again confusing to the consumer. * Where BB could play more is in areas like sport shirts. By all means offer your classics like blackwatch etc., but other menswear shops like Sid Mashburn or Todd Snyder offer all kinds of fun prints and colors while still feeling like classic #menswear.  i dunno, just riffing my own personal desires for BB. i don't know anything about running a large clothing manufacturer and retailer.

text:how often do you wash your clothes?	labels:it depends on the item of clothing? like I do laundry weekly, but I wash things separately. sheets and towels etc are washed with an unscented soap in one load, certain clothes are hand washed and line dried, some clothes are run in a cold cycle, some clothes are worn multiple times before washing. so it varies widely but laundry every 1-2 weeks makes sense for me when I‚Äôm only doing my own laundry
text:Wow that sounds so COMPLICATED!!  I throw everything in together, always at 30 synthetic.  I sometimes do more than one load, but only divided to make two loads of similar weight.  I don't have a dryer, line dry when possible.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Brands that are actually great that you discovered on Instagram?	labels:Ruggable!  Amazing customer service and cool product.  Edit: (I was fast scrolling and didn‚Äôt realize this was in Female fashion advice.  I‚Äôm not advising you wear a rug.  I‚Äôm such a dork!)
text:I actually hate my Ruggable. I love the design, but it is horrible for a house with dogs that shed a lot. The only way I‚Äôve found to get hair out of the rug is to get down and scrape it with my hands. Since using the vacuum with the brush (which would normally loosen hair) separates it from the Velcro and causes it to wrinkle, it‚Äôs impossible. Also, the edges are always rolling up.   Ok, end rant!	labels:Is it microfiber? Is that why?  R/cleaning would tell you to use a squeegee. Them peeps obsessed with squeegeeing pet hair off carpets. I've been SO skeptical of ruggable bc of pets & my kid.
text:I typically use a dog brush on the carpet, in short brisk strokes. It gets a lot of hair out!	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Inspo album: Keith Richards and the Rolling Stones	labels:I LOVE that you included Hayley Williams! Gosh, I thought her style was the absolute coolest when I was younger	episode_done:True
